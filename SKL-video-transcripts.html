        <h3 id="Vid01">Introduction to ‘green skills’</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Professor Jennifer O’Brien</strong></p>
        <p>This is a call to action.</p>

<p>I would argue that our climate is not changing.</p>

<p>IT HAS CHANGED.</p>

<p>In Manchester, we know that our average temperature has increased by .75 °C since 1961. Average rainfall is all over the place, with a decrease in summer rainfall between 10 and 25%, whilst winter rainfall has increased by between 10-50% since 1961. Whilst it is often said that there is no planet B, in fact there is no planet B for humankind. Our fair planet has been around for a lot longer than human beings, and unless we do something radical, it may indeed be around a lot longer after us. As you will learn across our interlinked challenges, we are already on borrowed time. We need transformation. And at the heart of that transformation is the need for every job to be a green job, enabled by green skills.</p>

<p>“So what are green skills?”</p>

<p>I honestly wish I had a pound for every time I was asked that question.</p>

<p>My response is to ask you to close your eyes. To consider the world that you would like to see in 50 years. Write yourself a postcard from the future. Green skills are what is needed to achieve that world. A world, an economy, a society, a business, that is greener, yes, but also fairer, healthier, wealthier, and in which nobody is left behind. Whatever the world you imagined, I’m sure that within it, your family, your neighbours, your community, your economy, and yourself are flourishing. Your imagined future, where no one is left behind, rests on how we define and pursue sustainability in the present. To bring it into focus, we need to understand the frameworks that shape our current thinking.</p>

<p>You’ve likely heard about the triple bottom line of sustainability and that sustainable development sits within a balance of considerations of people, profit, and planet. As an Industrial City, Manchester led the way in growing our economy. Growth was economic, with little consideration of how the ‘Great Acceleration’ impacted the environment, or how we share resources at multiple scales. That economic system also framed an educational system that classically measures success as jobs, as income and GDP. In this challenge, you’ll hear about intersectionalities and how fair green growth requires the triple bottom line to intersect with issues such as gender, race, social injustice, and our colonial history, to name just a few examples.</p>

<p>So, if we are to move beyond outdated models of growth and education, we need new ways of thinking, being, and doing. That’s where green skills come in.</p>

<p>There are lots of models and frameworks for green skills – and don’t forget we are talking about transformative learning and action that will facilitate and catalyse the transition to low-carbon and resource-efficient models, bringing as many people along as possible in the process.</p>

<p>Green skills are the knowledge and technical expertise for a more sustainable future. Those green skills build abilities and competencies that enable individuals and teams to work, live and play, in an environmentally responsible manner.</p>

<p>Classic work by Singleton, for example, suggests that the holistic nature of transformation requires the ‘head, heart and hand model’. The model shows the holistic nature of transformative experience linking the cognitive domain (the head) to critical reflection, the affective domain (the heart) to relational knowing, and the psychomotor domain (the hands) to active engagement by actually doing something.</p>

<p>The context of place provides a framework for authentic engagement. How sustainable is your office? How sustainable is your travel and procurement? These questions of place and practice remind us that sustainability isn’t abstract, it’s lived and shaped by everyday decisions. And it’s through green skills that this kind of transformation becomes possible.</p>

<p>So what are the types of green skills?</p>

<p>Amidst some debate about semantics, generally speaking it is said that there are three categories, or types of green skills: Technical skills, core skills and behavioural or soft skills (I’ll come back to my critique of the term ‘soft’ momentarily).</p>

<p>Technical skills are role, or task, specific competencies which are needed to implement sustainable practices. These might be day to day such as being able to calculate a personal carbon footprint, or buying the best recycled paper, to being highly technical such as enabling renewable energy, waste management and so forth.</p>

<p>Core skills, sometimes called transverse skills, apply across job roles and support environmental consciousness such as critical thinking and problem-solving with sustainability in mind. This approach leads to the idea that every job should be a green job which we will discuss more in the next video.</p>

<p>Behavioural skills, or soft skills, enable collaboration and influence necessary for green transitions. The term ‘soft’ skills is, to my mind, problematic as it infers weakness or fragility and generally suggests they are less important. I would, in fact, argue that often these ‘soft’ skills in leadership, communication, advocacy and so forth, are far from weak and actually often harder to teach, or train within a work setting than the technical skills of – for example - how to undertake a life cycle analysis or fit a ground source heat pump.</p>

<p>Those green skills enable the competencies that can be applied to any green job – as we will discuss next.</p>

        <h3 id="Vid01a">How we are helping make Manchester a Zero Carbon city by 2038</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Manchester City Council</strong></p>
        <p>The world is waking up to the climate crisis. Nowhere is untouched. From raging wildfires and scorching heatwaves to devastating flash floods and disappearing glaciers, the evidence is all around us. Climate change, driven by man-made CO₂ emissions, can no longer be ignored.</p>

<p>Manchester has been taking serious action on climate change for over two decades. In 2018, the city set an ambitious target to become zero carbon by 2038—twelve years ahead of the national goal. The following year, we became one of the first councils in the UK to declare a climate emergency, underlining the urgency of the task ahead.</p>

<p>Our Climate Change Action Plan for 2020–2025 outlines how the council, as an organisation, will cut its own carbon emissions by 50% by 2025. Alongside this, a citywide framework shows how everyone—residents, businesses, and institutions—must play a role in the transition.</p>

<p>Two years into the plan, we’ve already achieved a great deal. We’ve retrofitted some of our highest-emitting buildings with renewable energy solutions to reduce emissions and cut energy costs. For example, solar panels have been installed at Withington Sephora, and we’ve secured millions in funding to expand this work further.</p>

<p>We’re developing a shared power and heating system—Manchester’s Civic Water Heat Network—that will reduce emissions from some of the city centre’s most iconic buildings. It even includes a striking tower to showcase our progress—because this is Manchester, and we don’t do things by halves.</p>

<p>We’re also leading on cleaner transport. Manchester now has more electric bin lorries than any other council. We’ve created West Gorton’s new sponge park to prevent flooding and are using its success as a model for future nature-based solutions. A three-year, million-pound tree-planting programme is underway, with the first thousand trees already taking root across the city.</p>

<p>We’re securing millions to invest in active travel—so walking and cycling become the first choice for getting around. Green spaces like the new Mayfield Park in the city centre are bringing nature back into people’s lives, offering benefits for wellbeing and the environment alike.</p>

<p>Our planning system is evolving too. We’re working on new rules to ensure that new developments are net zero carbon. We’re championing improvements in public transport, active travel, and electric vehicle infrastructure—making it easier for everyone to make climate-friendly choices.</p>

<p>We’re also minimising emissions on key infrastructure projects. For example, only electric vehicles are being used during the restoration of Manchester’s historic Town Hall.</p>

<p>Right now, we’re on track to meet our target of a 50% reduction in emissions by 2025. But we know this is just the beginning.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, we aim to go even further. We’re exploring radical ideas—like developing our own large-scale solar farm to generate renewable energy for the city.</p>

<p>We do all this because we are Manchester. And we’re determined to play our part in tackling the global climate crisis.</p>

<p>So come on, Manchester. We’re doing our bit—now it’s time to do yours. Together, we can meet our targets and build a greener, cleaner future.</p>

        <h3 id="Vid02">Introduction to green competencies</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Professor Jennifer O’Brien</strong></p>
        <p>I work with Education for Sustainable Development, known as ESD.</p>

<p>ESD, is not solely about environmental issues as is commonly misconstrued, but focuses on the connections between economic, social and environmental factors – the triple bottom line of sustainability that we mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>ESD is an educational change agenda grounded in transformative learning and critical pedagogy (that’s teaching). It can be understood as a lens that permits us to look critically at how the world is, and to envision how it might be, and equips us to deliver that vision.</p>

<p>ESD develops competencies, that is, attributes and values learned through green skills - and how they link to subject knowledge. This is also where ESD can – and arguably must - be deployed in any subject, or workspace. Capabilities to enable the green transition can be fostered within maths as much as Geography, Finance as much as Environmental Consulting. Every job needs to be a green job.</p>

<p>The goal of ESD is to transform the environmental perspectives of learners to understand the interdependence of environmental integrity, social justice and economic prosperity, while acknowledging that environmental resources are finite and provide the foundation for our society and economy. An important part of that, to my mind, is individuals recognising their capacity to affect change within an interconnected system. That’s why I like the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, which do include Carbon, in SDG13, but also considers the holistic, interlinked nature of sustainable development in which gender, diversity and inclusion, life on land and quality education - to name but a few - are equally valued and bring everybody together in action, leaving nobody behind. Within the SDGs, there is something that everyone can feel passionate about - something that can inspire action.</p>

<p>Given how complex and messy sustainability can be, it’s important to recognise that learning, training, and developing sustainable practices may not be a linear process. Instead, a process of ongoing and cyclical reflection and evaluation is needed, which considers what has and has not worked well, what can be improved and takes into account the views of all involved.</p>

<p>According to UNESCO, ESD aims to develop competencies that empower individuals to reflect on their own actions, taking into account their current and future social, cultural, economic and environmental impacts, from a local and a global perspective. They are underpinned and reinforced by green skills—ranging from the technical, like fitting a ground source heat pump or choosing the best recycled paper for the office, to core skills such as systems thinking and change management, through to the behavioural, or so-called ‘soft’ skills, including advocacy, adaptability, and leadership.</p>

<p>UNESCO presents eight core competencies for ESD, that frame the SDGs, and many other commonly used frameworks and tools, such as Carbon Literacy, Sulitest and so forth. They are grouped into three categories, ‘ways of thinking’, ‘ways of being’ and ‘ways of practicing’ - head, heart and hands. This framework reflects the idea that sustainability competencies are not just about knowledge or technical skill, but about mindset, identity, and action.</p>

<p>Let’s start with ways of thinking - the head.</p>

<p>Systems thinking enables individuals to recognise and understand relationships, to analyse complex systems and consider how systems are embedded within different domains and scales whilst being able to deal with uncertainty. Systems thinking is a way of approaching problems that analyses how all the elements within a system influence one another. To be competent at systems thinking means you have the knowledge, skills and values to understand the complexity of sustainability, work within it, and affect change.</p>

<p>Critical thinking question norms, practices and opinions. It enables individuals to reflect on one’s own values, perceptions and actions and then to take a position in the sustainable development discourse. Critical thinking is perhaps more of an important competency than ever in an era of mal and disinformation through AI and social media and increasingly widespread green washing.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at ways of being.</p>

<p>Whether it is food, energy, travel, weather, we simply cannot untangle human life from the physical environment. Recognising, appreciating and valuing that link frames just how important sustainability is. Indigenous ways of learning, for example, are grounded in the meaningful context of inter-relationships and nature experience. Nature experience though, isn’t universal; it is a luxury to have access to nature and wilderness. We have established a green classroom, or allotment, on campus, in part for our community members to access green space that they don’t have at home, and to grow food. Indeed, whenever I am overwhelmed by fear for the future and eco anxiety: I dig. I get my hands dirty and remember the strength of the earth that we are protecting. Experience is important and enables self-awareness as a ‘way of being’.</p>

<p>And finally, there’s ways of practicing.</p>

<p>Perhaps you could consider team days where you restore the environment, get into nature, and bring the team together whilst you enhance your wellbeing and remind yourself why our small blue dot is worth saving.</p>

<p>So, what are green competencies? We know that green skills are individual capabilities, while green competencies are the integrated application of those skills (with knowledge and attitudes) in professional and societal contexts. Embedding green skills into competency models is essential for driving a just transition to a more sustainable economy and equipping individuals to meet the interlinked challenges of climate change and environmental degradation.</p>

        <h3 id="Vid03">Decolonising environmental education</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Dr Marcellus Mbah</strong></p>
        <p>What does "decolonising environmental education" mean?</p>

<p>Decolonising means taking apart old ways of thinking and systems that were put in place during colonial times and still affect us today.</p>

<p>It is undoing the lasting impacts of historical power imbalances and restoring autonomy, dignity, and indigenous or local knowledge systems.</p>

<p>When we talk about "decolonising environmental education," it means:</p>

<p>Rethinking traditional Western-centric approaches</p>

<p>Bringing in other valuable knowledge, especially from Indigenous peoples and local communities, to find better solutions for our environmental problems.</p>

<p>Changing how we teach and learn – including about nature and sustainability.</p>

<p>Historically, colonial education systems often pushed European languages, histories, and values, while ignoring or even erasing the rich knowledge, cultures, and languages of Indigenous communities. For example, missionary schools taught European values and suppressed local wisdom and customs.</p>

<p>Why is this so important for the environment?</p>

<p>Decolonising isn't just about correcting past wrongs; it's crucial for addressing climate change and other environmental issues effectively. Here's why:</p>

<p>The common Western approach to sustainable development often suggests there's a universal plan that works everywhere. This ignores the fact that different places have unique histories, ecosystems, and local knowledge systems.</p>

<p>For instance, the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) faced challenges in Africa partly because they were designed "top-down," without enough input from local African communities and Indigenous voices. This made it hard for those goals to be relatable to local needs.</p>

<p>It also results in shifting environmental burdens. This Western model typically leads to poorer regions and communities unfairly bearing the brunt of environmental problems.</p>

<p>Examples include:</p>

<p>Outsourcing dirty industries like textile manufacturing.</p>

<p>Sending our waste, like plastics and electronic trash, to other countries.</p>

<p>And "Land grabs" for resources needed for "green energy" or carbon offsetting projects, which can displace local communities.</p>

<p>Using a "decolonial lens" is vital not only for understanding environmental issues but also for finding real solutions.</p>

<p>Indigenous Peoples manage about 25% of the world's land, which contains a lot of the planet's biodiversity and stored carbon.</p>

<p>A large portion of this land is forest, vital to 70 million Indigenous Peoples' traditions and livelihoods.</p>

<p>Indigenous knowledge offers incredibly valuable insights.</p>

<p>Unlike some colonial conservation models that separate people from nature, Indigenous approaches are built on stewardship, reciprocity, and sustainability that have been perfected over thousands of years.</p>

<p>Research shows that areas managed by Indigenous Peoples are often healthier than the surrounding ones, even with increasing external pressures. They provide a crucial "environmental service" by safeguarding these key ecosystems that act as carbon sinks and protect biodiversity.</p>

<p>Indigenous knowledge provides effective solutions, for example:</p>

<p><strong>The Milpa System among the Maya in Mexico:</strong> This is a traditional farming method where different crops like corn, beans, and squash are rotated within a forested area. This system allows for natural forest regrowth in previously farmed plots, creating "forest gardens" that maintain high biodiversity and soil health, helping with climate change.</p>

<p><strong>Agroforestry in West Africa:</strong> In places like Mali and Burkina Faso, Indigenous Peoples have developed advanced farming systems where crops grow alongside trees. This helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility. Growing diverse crops also reduces the risk of total crop failure from pests, diseases, or extreme weather, securing food and livelihoods.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Burning among the Aboriginal Peoples in Australia:</strong> This practice involves carefully using low-intensity fires to manage the landscape, reduce fuel for wildfires, and promote biodiversity. Indigenous Peoples have deep knowledge of fire behaviour, weather, and ecological responses, allowing them to conduct these burns safely and effectively.</p>

<p>What skills does a decolonial approach foster?</p>

<p>Taking a decolonial approach to environmental sustainability helps us develop important skills that are often overlooked in mainstream Western models. It focuses on justice, good relationships, and respect for all knowledge systems. This approach helps us not just fix environmental problems, but also change the underlying values, systems, and relationships that caused them.</p>

<p>It encourages us to:</p>

<p>Think deeply about why environmental crises started.</p>

<p>Act responsibly in our relationships with the land and with each other.</p>

<p>Work together across different cultures and power levels.</p>

<p>Imagine new, better futures based on care, mutual respect, and community.</p>

<p>At its heart, a decolonial approach transforms sustainability from just a list of goals into a profound cultural and systemic shift. It challenges domination and re-centres balance, humility, and connection with the world.</p>
