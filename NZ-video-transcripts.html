        <h3 id="Vid01">Introduction to climate and emissions</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Dr Andrew Welfle</strong></p>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what powers your home, your transport, or even the food you eat? Behind almost everything we do, there’s a hidden footprint—carbon emissions. These emissions are a key driver of climate change and understanding them is crucial if we want to build a more sustainable future. In this short video, we’ll explore what carbon emissions are, where they come from, and how they connect to climate change and our daily lives.</p>

<p>Carbon emissions refer to carbon dioxide (CO₂) released into the atmosphere. CO₂ is a type of greenhouse gas—a gas that traps heat in the Earth’s atmosphere. While some greenhouse gases occur naturally and help keep our planet warm enough to live on, human activities have drastically increased the amount of CO₂ in the air, upsetting this natural balance.</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide mainly comes from burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. These fuels are used to produce energy, power vehicles, run factories, and heat buildings. When we burn them, we release carbon that was once stored underground into the atmosphere as CO₂.</p>

<p>But that’s not the only source. Other everyday activities—from deforestation to farming—also contribute to emissions. Even making things like cement and steel releases CO₂.</p>

<p>So where do carbon emissions come from? Let’s break down some of the main sources of carbon emissions:</p>

<p><strong></strong>Energy production</strong><br>
Most of the world’s electricity still comes from burning fossil fuels. Power plants that run on coal, oil, or gas emit large amounts of CO₂. While renewable sources like wind and solar are growing fast, they still make up a smaller share of global energy.</p>

<p><strong>Transportation</strong><br>
Cars, lorries, ships, and airplanes mostly run on petrol or diesel. Burning these fuels releases CO₂. In fact, the transport sector is one of the fastest-growing sources of emissions globally.</p>

<p><strong>Industry and manufacturing</strong><br>
Factories that produce goods—from clothing to electronics to building materials—often use fossil fuels for power and heat. Some processes, like making cement or steel, release carbon dioxide as part of the chemical reactions involved.</p>

<p><strong>Agriculture and land use</strong><br>
Farming practices also contribute to carbon emissions, especially when forests are cleared for farmland. Trees naturally absorb CO₂ from the air, so cutting them down means more carbon stays in the atmosphere. Livestock farming, especially cattle, also produces methane—a greenhouse gas that is even more powerful than CO₂ over short timeframes.</p>

<p><strong>Buildings and construction</strong><br>
Heating and cooling buildings, cooking, and using appliances all require energy. If that energy comes from fossil fuels, it adds to carbon emissions. Materials used in construction like concrete and steel also have a high carbon footprint.</p>

<p>So how does carbon emissions drive climate change? The Earth has a natural system for regulating temperature, and greenhouse gases are part of that. They trap some of the sun’s heat, keeping the planet warm enough to support life. But when we add too much CO₂ to the atmosphere, it traps more heat than necessary. This leads to global warming.</p>

<p>Over the last century, as carbon emissions have increased, so have global temperatures. We’re already seeing the impacts: rising sea levels, stronger storms, more intense wildfires, and longer droughts. These changes affect not just nature but also human health, food security, water availability, and our economies.</p>

<p>The more carbon we emit, the faster and more extreme these changes become.</p>

<p>Scientists use the idea of a “carbon budget” to help us understand how much CO₂ we can emit and still stay within safe temperature limits. To limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels—a key target in the Paris Agreement—we need to drastically cut emissions within this decade.</p>

<p>That means reducing fossil fuel use, protecting forests, improving energy efficiency, and shifting to low-carbon technologies like electric vehicles and renewable energy.</p>

<p>Tackling carbon emissions requires action at all levels—from international agreements to personal choices.</p>

<p><strong>Governments</strong> can pass laws to reduce emissions, invest in clean energy, and support greener transport and infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Businesses</strong> can improve energy efficiency, reduce waste, and offer low-carbon products and services.</p>

<p><strong>Communities</strong> can promote local renewable energy projects, public transport, and sustainable food systems.</p>

<p><strong>Individuals</strong> can also make a difference. Walking or biking instead of driving, using less energy at home, wasting less food, and choosing plant-based meals are all ways to reduce your own carbon footprint.</p>

<p>Reducing emissions is crucial but so is removing CO₂ that’s already in the atmosphere. Nature-based solutions—like restoring forests or protecting wetlands—can absorb carbon from the air. New technologies like direct air capture are also being developed to pull CO₂ out of the atmosphere and store it safely underground.</p>

<p>Carbon offsetting is another tool. It allows individuals or companies to compensate for their emissions by supporting projects that reduce or capture emissions elsewhere—like tree planting or renewable energy.</p>

<p>However, offsetting should not replace reducing emissions at the source. It’s a helpful supplement, not a solution on its own.</p>

<p>One of the challenges with carbon emissions and climate change is that they can create feedback loops. These are chain reactions that make the problem worse.</p>

<p>For example, as Arctic ice melts due to warming, less sunlight is reflected back into space, and more is absorbed by the darker ocean. This leads to even more warming, which melts more ice—a positive feedback loop.</p>

<p>Another loop involves permafrost—frozen ground in places like Siberia. As temperatures rise, permafrost thaws and releases methane and CO₂ that have been trapped for thousands of years. This adds more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and speeds up warming.</p>

<p>Understanding these loops is important because they show how climate change can escalate quickly if we don’t act.</p>

<p>Carbon emissions are one of the biggest drivers of climate change. They come from many of the things we rely on—energy, transport, food, and industry. But by understanding where they come from and how they affect the planet, we can take meaningful action to reduce them.</p>

<p>Climate change is not a distant threat—it’s happening now. But we still have time to make a difference. And the choices we make today will shape the kind of future we leave for generations to come.</p>

        <h3 id="Vid01a">It’s Climate Crunch Time. It’s Time to Level Up.</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: UN Environment Programme</strong></p>
        <p>It's climate crunch time. It's time to level up.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario one: We win.</strong> With a massive collective effort, we limit global warming to 1.5°C. Ambitions are raised. Nationally determined contributions deliver unprecedented impact. We cut global emissions by 42% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels. We invest in solar energy and wind power. We protect nature and economies. We live.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario two: We survive but struggle.</strong> We manage to limit global warming to 2°C. We cut emissions by 28% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels. We make some progress, for example with renewable energy and forest conservation. But it's not enough. Heatwaves, floods and rising seas hit hard. We adapt, but at a cost.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario three: We fail.</strong> Global warming reaches 2.6°C and beyond. Current promises fall short. Emissions continue to rise. We face dangerous heat, severe storms and extreme weather. Ecosystems break down. Many lives are lost. The cost of reversing the damage becomes overwhelming. Game over.</p>

<p>Which future do we want? What future will we choose?</p>

<p>No more hot air, please. 1.5°C is possible. The future is in our hands.</p>

        <h3 id="Vid02">What is Net-Zero?</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Dr Andrew Welfle</strong></p>
        <p>When we hear about climate change solutions, one term keeps coming up: Net Zero. But what does it actually mean? And why does it matter so much?</p>

<p>In this video, we’ll explore what Net Zero is, how it fits into the global climate agenda, what reaching it will require, and the complex challenges that stand in the way.</p>

<p>Net Zero refers to the balance between the greenhouse gases we emit and the amount we can remove or absorb. It doesn’t mean we stop emitting entirely. Instead, we reduce emissions as much as possible and then offset what remains—using methods like planting trees, restoring wetlands, or using emerging technologies like carbon capture and storage.</p>

<p>The aim is to stop adding to the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Because once we reach that balance—where emissions in equal removals out—we halt further warming.</p>

<p>This is essential. Greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, trap heat in our atmosphere. The more we emit, the more the planet warms. This leads to higher sea levels, stronger storms, more frequent heatwaves, and widespread disruption to food, water, health, and ecosystems.</p>

<p>In 2015, nearly every country in the world signed the Paris Agreement—a landmark international treaty adopted at the 21st UN Climate Conference, or COP21. The agreement commits nations to limit global temperature rise to well below 2°C, and ideally no more than 1.5°C, above pre-industrial levels.</p>

<p>Hitting the 1.5°C target requires the world to reach Net Zero emissions by around 2050. This isn’t just a political goal—it’s grounded in climate science. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), staying within 1.5°C means cutting global emissions by roughly half by 2030, and reaching Net Zero around the middle of the century.</p>

<p>More than 140 countries have now set Net Zero targets. That includes the world’s biggest emitters—China, the US, and the EU—as well as many developing nations. But while the target is clear, the path is anything but easy.</p>

<p>Achieving Net Zero globally means transforming nearly every part of how we live, work, and produce. It’s a massive shift—technologically, economically, and socially.</p>

<p>We must rapidly phase out fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas, which currently supply about 80% of the world’s energy. That means replacing them with renewable sources like wind, solar, hydro, and geothermal. Energy systems must be redesigned to be cleaner, more flexible, and more interconnected. This also involves expanding energy storage, modernising power grids, and developing zero-carbon fuels like green hydrogen for sectors where electricity isn’t practical.</p>

<p>Heavy industries such as steel, cement, and chemicals are especially hard to decarbonise. These processes rely on high-temperature heat and produce emissions that are difficult to eliminate. Solutions may include carbon capture technologies, cleaner industrial processes, and innovation in materials. But many of these approaches are still in early stages or costly at scale.</p>

<p>Transportation—cars, lorries, ships, and planes—accounts for a large share of emissions, roughly 15%. The transition involves moving to electric vehicles, expanding public transport, developing sustainable aviation fuels, and exploring alternatives like hydrogen for freight and shipping.</p>

<p>Heating, cooling, and powering buildings contributes significantly to emissions. Making buildings more energy efficient, replacing fossil-fuel heating with electric heat pumps, and retrofitting existing infrastructure are crucial steps—especially in growing urban areas.</p>

<p>Forests, soils, and oceans absorb carbon naturally. Protecting and restoring these ecosystems is essential, both for capturing emissions and for supporting biodiversity and resilience. Sustainable agriculture, reforestation, and peatland restoration are powerful tools—but they cannot substitute for deep cuts in fossil fuel use.</p>

<p>Innovation and Investment:<br>
Many of the technologies we need exist today—but they must be deployed much more widely, and new innovations will also be necessary. This requires massive investment, not only from governments but also from the private sector. A just and effective Net Zero transition must also support workers and communities whose economies currently depend on high-carbon industries.</p>

<p>So what’s standing in the way?</p>

<p>The scale of change required is enormous. The world needs to cut emissions in half by 2030, which is just years away. That means doubling or tripling the deployment of renewables, transforming industries, redesigning cities, and overhauling supply chains—all while meeting growing energy demands, especially in developing regions.</p>

<p>Not all countries face the same starting point. Richer nations have contributed the most to climate change historically by emitting the most greenhouse gases, but poorer countries are often the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change—and sometimes the least equipped to respond. A fair Net Zero transition must account for this imbalance. Wealthier countries will need to support developing nations through climate finance, technology transfer, and capacity building.</p>

<p>At the same time, within countries, there are social and economic divides. Shifting to clean energy can create new jobs but also threatens existing ones in fossil fuel industries. Managing this transition justly means investing in training, reskilling, and social safety nets.</p>

<p>Climate action depends on bold and coordinated policymaking. But political will is often uneven and fragile. Short election cycles, lobbying from high-carbon industries, and public resistance to change can all slow progress. Even in countries with Net Zero targets, policies often fall short of what's needed to deliver on those goals.</p>

<p>There’s also the risk of greenwashing—where companies or governments claim to be pursuing Net Zero without making meaningful changes. Clear rules, accountability, and transparency are essential.</p>

<p>Some Net Zero strategies rely heavily on technologies like carbon capture, direct air capture, or negative emissions from bioenergy. But many of these are still unproven at scale or extremely expensive. While they may be part of the solution, they can’t be used to delay the hard work of reducing emissions now.</p>

<p>Overreliance on future technologies could also create moral hazards, where delayed action today is justified by promises of innovation tomorrow.</p>

<p>Finally, reaching Net Zero isn’t just about systems—it’s about people. Changing behaviour, shifting mindsets, and reimagining what progress looks like are essential parts of the journey. That includes changes in consumption, travel, food systems, and values. These shifts are often slower and harder to measure—but they’re just as important.</p>

<p>Net Zero is not just a technical target. It’s a global transformation—one that touches every sector of the economy and every aspect of our lives. Reaching it will require extraordinary effort, rapid innovation, and unprecedented cooperation across borders and generations.</p>

<p>But the alternative—unchecked climate change—is far more costly.</p>

        <h3 id="Vid03">Carbon footprint basics</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Dr Lois Pennington</strong></p>
        <p>We’re all familiar with the idea of budgeting money, planning how much we can spend and deciding where it goes.</p>

<p>But did you know we use a similar idea to tackle climate change?</p>

<p>It’s called a carbon budget. It sets a limit on how much greenhouse gas the world can emit while still avoiding the worst effects of global warming.</p>

<p>And just like a financial budget, the more we “spend” now, the less we’ll have to work with in the future.</p>

<p>To stick to this global limit, we need to understand where emissions come from, who is responsible, and what we can do to reduce them.</p>

<p>In this video, we’ll look at how carbon budgets are calculated, how we track emissions, and how large organisations, like universities, are using this information to plan for a lower-carbon future.</p>

<p>We’ll also reflect on how responsibility is shared - and why individual action alone isn’t enough to solve a global problem.</p>

<p>Climate scientists have modelled how much the Earth warms up when we emit greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.</p>

<p>Using this information, we can estimate how much more of these warming gases the world can emit before we exceed critical temperature thresholds—particularly 1.5°C and 2°C above pre-industrial levels. These limits are global targets set out in the Paris Agreement, which has been signed by nearly every country.</p>

<p>The total of these allowable emissions is known as the global carbon budget.</p>

<p>Although it’s called a "carbon" budget, it includes all major greenhouse gases. To make them easier to track, they’re converted into a common unit: carbon dioxide equivalent. This allows us to compare the warming effects of different gases and count them together.</p>

<p>Once we know the size of the global budget, the next big question is: how do we divide it fairly?</p>

<p>You can think of the budget as a pie, and there are different ways to slice it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By population, so each person gets an equal share</li>
  <li>By wealth, or how much each country has emitted historically</li>
  <li>Grandfathering – continuing based on past emissions (though widely criticised as unfair)</li>
  <li>By sectors, like transport, energy, or agriculture</li>
</ul>

<p>The Paris Agreement says the budget should be shared equitably, recognising that some countries have emitted far more than others, and some have greater capacity to act.</p>

<p>That’s why wealthier countries, like the UK, are expected to reduce emissions more quickly, while lower-income countries have more flexibility as they continue to develop.</p>

<p>But this question of fairness also applies within countries.</p>

<p>Emissions vary massively between sectors, regions, organisations, and individuals. Some industries, like aviation or construction, use far more of the budget than others.</p>

<p>That’s why carbon budgets are also applied at national, city, sector, and organisational levels, to help track progress and share responsibility for reducing emissions.</p>

<p>To take action on emissions, we first need to measure them, and that’s where carbon accounting comes in.</p>

<p>The most widely used method divides emissions into three categories, or “scopes”:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Scope 1</strong>: Direct emissions from sources the organisation owns or controls (e.g., fuel used in vehicles or machinery)</li>
  <li><strong>Scope 2</strong>: Indirect emissions from purchased energy, like electricity used to power buildings</li>
  <li><strong>Scope 3</strong>: All other indirect emissions, caused by the organisation’s activities but from sources it doesn’t control (e.g., commuting, supply chains, waste)</li>
</ul>

<p>Essentially, Scope 1 emissions are under your control, while Scope 2 and 3 are a consequence of your actions, but they happen elsewhere.</p>

<p>Scope 3 is usually the largest, and often the most complex to measure. But that also means it’s where some of the biggest opportunities lie.</p>

<p>Let’s take a university as an example.</p>

<p>It uses carbon footprinting to understand its impact:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scope 1 includes direct emissions from university-owned vans and equipment (these could be reduced by switching to electric vehicles)</li>
  <li>Scope 2 includes electricity used across campus buildings (reductions might involve energy efficiency upgrades or switching to renewable suppliers)</li>
  <li>Scope 3 includes indirect emissions from things like commuting, flights for research, construction, and procurement (these could be tackled by promoting public transport, choosing low-carbon materials, or revising purchasing practices)</li>
</ul>

<p>This kind of footprinting helps the university, and other organisations, see where emissions come from, and where reductions are possible.</p>

<p>You might have used a carbon footprint calculator before, a tool that estimates your personal emissions based on things like travel, diet, and energy use.</p>

<p>These tools can be useful for raising awareness, but they only tell one part of the story.</p>

<p>Most emissions aren’t just about individual decisions. They’re shaped by larger systems, like how our energy is produced, how cities are built, and what policies are in place to support low-carbon choices.</p>

<p>Even if we do everything right as individuals, we still need systemic change to stay within the global carbon budget.</p>

<p>That’s why carbon budgets and footprinting are most powerful when applied at scale.</p>

<p>They help us to identify the biggest sources of emissions, understand who has control and influence, and hold systems and organisations—not just individuals—accountable.</p>

<p>Instead of only asking, "What's my carbon footprint?" we can start asking: "What systems am I part of, and how can those systems change?"</p>

<p>So, to summarise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A carbon budget is our global limit for greenhouse gas emissions</li>
  <li>There are many ways to divide it for countries, sectors, and individuals</li>
  <li>To measure emissions, we can use the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which groups emissions into Scopes 1, 2, and 3</li>
  <li>Organisations, like universities, use this to measure and reduce their impact</li>
  <li>And to really stay within our climate limits, we need system-wide change, not just personal action</li>
</ul>

        <h3 id="Vid04">Deep dive podcast: Super-Low Carbon Live Music – A roadmap for sustainable touring</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: AI</strong></p>
        <p>You know that feeling, right? Energy in the room, the lights go down. That first blast of sound from the stage. Live music is just electric. It really is. But there's another kind of energy involved, isn't there? Yeah. Exactly — like the actual power consumption, the travel, the whole environmental side of things. It's kind of the hidden cost. Often overlooked, and it turns out that amazing experience carries a pretty significant climate impact that, well, needs tackling. Urgently.</p>

<p>OK, so let's unpack this. Today we're doing a deep dive into a really critical plan — a road map for how the live music world can actually fight climate change. Our main source here is this big report commissioned by the band Massive Attack, which is interesting in itself. It was developed by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. They're specialists in the transition to low carbon. So this isn’t just wishful thinking — it’s properly researched. Got it. So our mission today is to get a handle on the core problem they identified, look at the solutions they’re actually proposing right across the sector, and understand what difference it could make if everyone actually does this stuff.</p>

<p>The problem, according to the sources, is clear — and it's not just one thing. You've got venues and festivals using a lot of energy. Standard building stuff like heating and lighting, yes. But often, the really dominant factors are transport — moving gear, crews, tour buses, and trucks. And, critically, how the audience gets to the show. That's often the biggest slice of the pie, and it all currently relies heavily on fossil fuels. So it's the whole system. The sources don’t pull punches: they say progress needs to be rapidly accelerated and requires substantial shifts. It’s not about small tweaks anymore.</p>

<p>So what are these substantial shifts? What solutions are we talking about? The road map gets specific, with clear targets and timelines. For permanent venues, the big target is zero CO2 emissions from the buildings by 2035. That sounds incredibly ambitious, but the source points out that it’s not about waiting for miracle technology. It’s about using what we already have — better energy efficiency, deep retrofits, solar panels on roofs, and switching heating and cooking away from gas. So, applying known solutions much faster and more widely. It’s about implementation, speed, and investment.</p>

<p>Now think about festivals. These big outdoor events often run on temporary power — usually diesel generators. Not exactly clean energy. The road map calls for phasing out diesel for temporary power by 2025. The goal is to match the grid’s carbon intensity, which means a big push for battery storage, microgrids, or even connecting festival sites to the main electricity grid where possible.</p>

<p>Then there's travel. Surface travel — trucks, buses — is a huge chunk. The target is zero emissions by 2035, which means electric vehicles, but also reducing the amount that needs to be transported in the first place. How? By rethinking touring models. Concepts like plug-and-play venues, where standardised good-quality backline gear is provided onsite, could mean bands don’t need to truck their own amps and drum kits everywhere. Less stuff to haul means fewer emissions. Massive Attack tested prioritising rail over road and cut their band travel emissions by 31% — just from switching to trains where possible.</p>

<p>Flying is the really tough one, especially for international tours. Electric planes aren’t ready for that scale yet. So the road map is realistic: the immediate focus has to be on reducing demand — flying less. The target is to cap total air miles for the sector at 80% of 2019 levels as touring ramps back up. That includes strongly discouraging private jets.</p>

<p>And then there’s the audience. Often the biggest part of the emissions pie is getting thousands of people to and from a venue. The road map pushes for deep collaboration between venues, promoters, and local government to improve public transport — especially late-night services — and to incentivise cycling, car sharing, and using greener options. Secure bike parking, for example. And absolutely not promoting flying to attend an event.</p>

<p>So when you put it all together — venues, festivals, power, touring, audience travel — this is a really comprehensive plan, with specific targets and timelines. It’s not just about music, either. The sources position this as a kind of blueprint, a case study for how almost any sector can approach the rapid transformation needed for climate goals. A model for others.</p>

<p>But having the plan is one thing. Making it happen is another. It needs everyone pulling together — artists, venues, promoters, government, and the audience too. And it has to be fair. The sources stress that the transition must support — or at least not harm — smaller players: independent venues and grassroots festivals. So that leads to a crucial question, one for you listening to think about. As this road map hopefully turns into action, how do we make sure this massive, necessary shift in live music is not just effective at cutting emissions, but also fair?
