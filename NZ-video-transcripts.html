        <h3 id="Vid04">Deep dive podcast: Super-Low Carbon Live Music – A roadmap for sustainable touring</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: AI</strong></p>
        <p>You know that feeling, right? Energy in the room, the lights go down. That first blast of sound from the stage. Live music is just electric. It really is. But there's another kind of energy involved, isn't there? Yeah. Exactly — like the actual power consumption, the travel, the whole environmental side of things. It's kind of the hidden cost. Often overlooked, and it turns out that amazing experience carries a pretty significant climate impact that, well, needs tackling. Urgently.</p>

<p>OK, so let's unpack this. Today we're doing a deep dive into a really critical plan — a road map for how the live music world can actually fight climate change. Our main source here is this big report commissioned by the band Massive Attack, which is interesting in itself. It was developed by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. They're specialists in the transition to low carbon. So this isn’t just wishful thinking — it’s properly researched. Got it. So our mission today is to get a handle on the core problem they identified, look at the solutions they’re actually proposing right across the sector, and understand what difference it could make if everyone actually does this stuff.</p>

<p>The problem, according to the sources, is clear — and it's not just one thing. You've got venues and festivals using a lot of energy. Standard building stuff like heating and lighting, yes. But often, the really dominant factors are transport — moving gear, crews, tour buses, and trucks. And, critically, how the audience gets to the show. That's often the biggest slice of the pie, and it all currently relies heavily on fossil fuels. So it's the whole system. The sources don’t pull punches: they say progress needs to be rapidly accelerated and requires substantial shifts. It’s not about small tweaks anymore.</p>

<p>So what are these substantial shifts? What solutions are we talking about? The road map gets specific, with clear targets and timelines. For permanent venues, the big target is zero CO2 emissions from the buildings by 2035. That sounds incredibly ambitious, but the source points out that it’s not about waiting for miracle technology. It’s about using what we already have — better energy efficiency, deep retrofits, solar panels on roofs, and switching heating and cooking away from gas. So, applying known solutions much faster and more widely. It’s about implementation, speed, and investment.</p>

<p>Now think about festivals. These big outdoor events often run on temporary power — usually diesel generators. Not exactly clean energy. The road map calls for phasing out diesel for temporary power by 2025. The goal is to match the grid’s carbon intensity, which means a big push for battery storage, microgrids, or even connecting festival sites to the main electricity grid where possible.</p>

<p>Then there's travel. Surface travel — trucks, buses — is a huge chunk. The target is zero emissions by 2035, which means electric vehicles, but also reducing the amount that needs to be transported in the first place. How? By rethinking touring models. Concepts like plug-and-play venues, where standardised good-quality backline gear is provided onsite, could mean bands don’t need to truck their own amps and drum kits everywhere. Less stuff to haul means fewer emissions. Massive Attack tested prioritising rail over road and cut their band travel emissions by 31% — just from switching to trains where possible.</p>

<p>Flying is the really tough one, especially for international tours. Electric planes aren’t ready for that scale yet. So the road map is realistic: the immediate focus has to be on reducing demand — flying less. The target is to cap total air miles for the sector at 80% of 2019 levels as touring ramps back up. That includes strongly discouraging private jets.</p>

<p>And then there’s the audience. Often the biggest part of the emissions pie is getting thousands of people to and from a venue. The road map pushes for deep collaboration between venues, promoters, and local government to improve public transport — especially late-night services — and to incentivise cycling, car sharing, and using greener options. Secure bike parking, for example. And absolutely not promoting flying to attend an event.</p>

<p>So when you put it all together — venues, festivals, power, touring, audience travel — this is a really comprehensive plan, with specific targets and timelines. It’s not just about music, either. The sources position this as a kind of blueprint, a case study for how almost any sector can approach the rapid transformation needed for climate goals. A model for others.</p>

<p>But having the plan is one thing. Making it happen is another. It needs everyone pulling together — artists, venues, promoters, government, and the audience too. And it has to be fair. The sources stress that the transition must support — or at least not harm — smaller players: independent venues and grassroots festivals. So that leads to a crucial question, one for you listening to think about. As this road map hopefully turns into action, how do we make sure this massive, necessary shift in live music is not just effective at cutting emissions, but also fair? How do we ensure it works for everyone — from global superstars to local clubs, and all the people working behind the scenes?</p>
