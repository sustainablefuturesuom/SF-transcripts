        <h3 id="Vid01">Introduction to climate and emissions</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Dr Andrew Welfle</strong></p>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what powers your home, your transport, or even the food you eat? Behind almost everything we do, there’s a hidden footprint—carbon emissions. These emissions are a key driver of climate change and understanding them is crucial if we want to build a more sustainable future. In this short video, we’ll explore what carbon emissions are, where they come from, and how they connect to climate change and our daily lives.</p>

<p>Carbon emissions refer to carbon dioxide (CO₂) released into the atmosphere. CO₂ is a type of greenhouse gas—a gas that traps heat in the Earth’s atmosphere. While some greenhouse gases occur naturally and help keep our planet warm enough to live on, human activities have drastically increased the amount of CO₂ in the air, upsetting this natural balance.</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide mainly comes from burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. These fuels are used to produce energy, power vehicles, run factories, and heat buildings. When we burn them, we release carbon that was once stored underground into the atmosphere as CO₂.</p>

<p>But that’s not the only source. Other everyday activities—from deforestation to farming—also contribute to emissions. Even making things like cement and steel releases CO₂.</p>

<p>So where do carbon emissions come from? Let’s break down some of the main sources of carbon emissions:</p>

<p><strong></strong>Energy production</strong><br>
Most of the world’s electricity still comes from burning fossil fuels. Power plants that run on coal, oil, or gas emit large amounts of CO₂. While renewable sources like wind and solar are growing fast, they still make up a smaller share of global energy.</p>

<p><strong>Transportation</strong><br>
Cars, lorries, ships, and airplanes mostly run on petrol or diesel. Burning these fuels releases CO₂. In fact, the transport sector is one of the fastest-growing sources of emissions globally.</p>

<p><strong>Industry and manufacturing</strong><br>
Factories that produce goods—from clothing to electronics to building materials—often use fossil fuels for power and heat. Some processes, like making cement or steel, release carbon dioxide as part of the chemical reactions involved.</p>

<p><strong>Agriculture and land use</strong><br>
Farming practices also contribute to carbon emissions, especially when forests are cleared for farmland. Trees naturally absorb CO₂ from the air, so cutting them down means more carbon stays in the atmosphere. Livestock farming, especially cattle, also produces methane—a greenhouse gas that is even more powerful than CO₂ over short timeframes.</p>

<p><strong>Buildings and construction</strong><br>
Heating and cooling buildings, cooking, and using appliances all require energy. If that energy comes from fossil fuels, it adds to carbon emissions. Materials used in construction like concrete and steel also have a high carbon footprint.</p>

<p>So how does carbon emissions drive climate change? The Earth has a natural system for regulating temperature, and greenhouse gases are part of that. They trap some of the sun’s heat, keeping the planet warm enough to support life. But when we add too much CO₂ to the atmosphere, it traps more heat than necessary. This leads to global warming.</p>

<p>Over the last century, as carbon emissions have increased, so have global temperatures. We’re already seeing the impacts: rising sea levels, stronger storms, more intense wildfires, and longer droughts. These changes affect not just nature but also human health, food security, water availability, and our economies.</p>

<p>The more carbon we emit, the faster and more extreme these changes become.</p>

<p>Scientists use the idea of a “carbon budget” to help us understand how much CO₂ we can emit and still stay within safe temperature limits. To limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels—a key target in the Paris Agreement—we need to drastically cut emissions within this decade.</p>

<p>That means reducing fossil fuel use, protecting forests, improving energy efficiency, and shifting to low-carbon technologies like electric vehicles and renewable energy.</p>

<p>Tackling carbon emissions requires action at all levels—from international agreements to personal choices.</p>

<p><strong>Governments</strong> can pass laws to reduce emissions, invest in clean energy, and support greener transport and infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Businesses</strong> can improve energy efficiency, reduce waste, and offer low-carbon products and services.</p>

<p><strong>Communities</strong> can promote local renewable energy projects, public transport, and sustainable food systems.</p>

<p><strong>Individuals</strong> can also make a difference. Walking or biking instead of driving, using less energy at home, wasting less food, and choosing plant-based meals are all ways to reduce your own carbon footprint.</p>

<p>Reducing emissions is crucial but so is removing CO₂ that’s already in the atmosphere. Nature-based solutions—like restoring forests or protecting wetlands—can absorb carbon from the air. New technologies like direct air capture are also being developed to pull CO₂ out of the atmosphere and store it safely underground.</p>

<p>Carbon offsetting is another tool. It allows individuals or companies to compensate for their emissions by supporting projects that reduce or capture emissions elsewhere—like tree planting or renewable energy.</p>

<p>However, offsetting should not replace reducing emissions at the source. It’s a helpful supplement, not a solution on its own.</p>

<p>One of the challenges with carbon emissions and climate change is that they can create feedback loops. These are chain reactions that make the problem worse.</p>

<p>For example, as Arctic ice melts due to warming, less sunlight is reflected back into space, and more is absorbed by the darker ocean. This leads to even more warming, which melts more ice—a positive feedback loop.</p>

<p>Another loop involves permafrost—frozen ground in places like Siberia. As temperatures rise, permafrost thaws and releases methane and CO₂ that have been trapped for thousands of years. This adds more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and speeds up warming.</p>

<p>Understanding these loops is important because they show how climate change can escalate quickly if we don’t act.</p>

<p>Carbon emissions are one of the biggest drivers of climate change. They come from many of the things we rely on—energy, transport, food, and industry. But by understanding where they come from and how they affect the planet, we can take meaningful action to reduce them.</p>

<p>Climate change is not a distant threat—it’s happening now. But we still have time to make a difference. And the choices we make today will shape the kind of future we leave for generations to come.</p>

        <h3 id="Vid04">Deep dive podcast: Super-Low Carbon Live Music – A roadmap for sustainable touring</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: AI</strong></p>
        <p>You know that feeling, right? Energy in the room, the lights go down. That first blast of sound from the stage. Live music is just electric. It really is. But there's another kind of energy involved, isn't there? Yeah. Exactly — like the actual power consumption, the travel, the whole environmental side of things. It's kind of the hidden cost. Often overlooked, and it turns out that amazing experience carries a pretty significant climate impact that, well, needs tackling. Urgently.</p>

<p>OK, so let's unpack this. Today we're doing a deep dive into a really critical plan — a road map for how the live music world can actually fight climate change. Our main source here is this big report commissioned by the band Massive Attack, which is interesting in itself. It was developed by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. They're specialists in the transition to low carbon. So this isn’t just wishful thinking — it’s properly researched. Got it. So our mission today is to get a handle on the core problem they identified, look at the solutions they’re actually proposing right across the sector, and understand what difference it could make if everyone actually does this stuff.</p>

<p>The problem, according to the sources, is clear — and it's not just one thing. You've got venues and festivals using a lot of energy. Standard building stuff like heating and lighting, yes. But often, the really dominant factors are transport — moving gear, crews, tour buses, and trucks. And, critically, how the audience gets to the show. That's often the biggest slice of the pie, and it all currently relies heavily on fossil fuels. So it's the whole system. The sources don’t pull punches: they say progress needs to be rapidly accelerated and requires substantial shifts. It’s not about small tweaks anymore.</p>

<p>So what are these substantial shifts? What solutions are we talking about? The road map gets specific, with clear targets and timelines. For permanent venues, the big target is zero CO2 emissions from the buildings by 2035. That sounds incredibly ambitious, but the source points out that it’s not about waiting for miracle technology. It’s about using what we already have — better energy efficiency, deep retrofits, solar panels on roofs, and switching heating and cooking away from gas. So, applying known solutions much faster and more widely. It’s about implementation, speed, and investment.</p>

<p>Now think about festivals. These big outdoor events often run on temporary power — usually diesel generators. Not exactly clean energy. The road map calls for phasing out diesel for temporary power by 2025. The goal is to match the grid’s carbon intensity, which means a big push for battery storage, microgrids, or even connecting festival sites to the main electricity grid where possible.</p>

<p>Then there's travel. Surface travel — trucks, buses — is a huge chunk. The target is zero emissions by 2035, which means electric vehicles, but also reducing the amount that needs to be transported in the first place. How? By rethinking touring models. Concepts like plug-and-play venues, where standardised good-quality backline gear is provided onsite, could mean bands don’t need to truck their own amps and drum kits everywhere. Less stuff to haul means fewer emissions. Massive Attack tested prioritising rail over road and cut their band travel emissions by 31% — just from switching to trains where possible.</p>

<p>Flying is the really tough one, especially for international tours. Electric planes aren’t ready for that scale yet. So the road map is realistic: the immediate focus has to be on reducing demand — flying less. The target is to cap total air miles for the sector at 80% of 2019 levels as touring ramps back up. That includes strongly discouraging private jets.</p>

<p>And then there’s the audience. Often the biggest part of the emissions pie is getting thousands of people to and from a venue. The road map pushes for deep collaboration between venues, promoters, and local government to improve public transport — especially late-night services — and to incentivise cycling, car sharing, and using greener options. Secure bike parking, for example. And absolutely not promoting flying to attend an event.</p>

<p>So when you put it all together — venues, festivals, power, touring, audience travel — this is a really comprehensive plan, with specific targets and timelines. It’s not just about music, either. The sources position this as a kind of blueprint, a case study for how almost any sector can approach the rapid transformation needed for climate goals. A model for others.</p>

<p>But having the plan is one thing. Making it happen is another. It needs everyone pulling together — artists, venues, promoters, government, and the audience too. And it has to be fair. The sources stress that the transition must support — or at least not harm — smaller players: independent venues and grassroots festivals. So that leads to a crucial question, one for you listening to think about. As this road map hopefully turns into action, how do we make sure this massive, necessary shift in live music is not just effective at cutting emissions, but also fair? How do we ensure it works for everyone — from global superstars to local clubs, and all the people working behind the scenes?</p>
