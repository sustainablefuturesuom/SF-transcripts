        <h3 id="Vid01">Introduction to climate change and resource sustainability </h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Dr Elisabeth Allen</strong></p>
        <p>Everything we use—our food, water, energy, and even our phones—comes from natural resources. But did you know that the way we use those resources is changing the world around us through climate change? And as the climate changes, it's also putting those same resources at risk. This short video will explain how resources such as food, fuel, and water, which are essential for life, are interlinked with climate change.</p>

<p>Think about your daily routine—turning on the lights, driving to work, eating a meal, or scrolling on your phone. Every one of those things depends on resources. Non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels, minerals, and metals take millions of years to form, whereas natural renewable resources such as sunlight, wind, and water will naturally replenish. However, the rate at which we use them can have adverse consequences.</p>

<p>Since the Industrial Revolution, we have been burning non-renewable fuel resources such as coal, oil, and gas to power our homes, cars, and factories. It’s the main way we produce energy around the world. But burning those fuels releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that traps heat in Earth’s atmosphere.</p>

<p>Food is another resource. Growing food uses land, water, and fertiliser. And raising livestock—especially cows—produces methane, a greenhouse gas that can have more adverse effects than carbon dioxide. Plus, forests are often cleared to make room for farms or pastures, which means fewer trees to absorb carbon from the air.</p>

<p>Water is another resource that is essential for all life on Earth. Whilst water is a renewable resource due to the Earth's water cycle, it is also a finite resource, meaning there's a limited amount of freshwater available for human use. Pumping, treating, and transporting water all use energy, and in many areas, overusing water can harm ecosystems or reduce natural carbon storage like wetlands.</p>

<p>So the way we use resources—energy, land, water, and raw materials—is deeply tied to climate change.</p>

<p>Let’s start with water. As temperatures rise, we’re seeing more droughts in some areas and heavier floods in others. Glaciers and snowpacks—nature’s water storage—are melting faster than ever, which puts millions at risk of losing their main source of freshwater. Rivers are shrinking, and underground water supplies are drying up in places where they’re needed most.</p>

<p>Next is food. Crops like wheat, rice, and corn don’t grow well in extreme heat or without steady rain. Unpredictable weather, longer dry seasons, and more intense storms are making it harder for farmers to grow enough food. That can drive up food prices and create shortages—especially in places already struggling.</p>

<p>Forests and ecosystems are also under stress. Wildfires, heatwaves, and pests that thrive in warmer climates are damaging large forest areas, which are crucial not just for wood and clean air, but also for storing carbon and regulating rainfall.</p>

<p>Even energy supplies are affected. Hydropower depends on steady water flow, and droughts reduce its capacity. Extreme weather can knock out power lines, damage infrastructure, and make energy less reliable—especially in places that depend on a single source.</p>

<p>So while climate change may seem like something abstract, it’s already reshaping the resources that keep our homes running, our bellies full, and our communities safe.</p>

<p>To add complexity to this all, the changes to resources and our climate can cause knock-on effects which in turn can create more changes and effects. These are called feedback loops.</p>

<p>Feedback loops, both positive and negative, play a crucial role in shaping climate change and influencing the availability of resources. Positive feedback loops amplify the effects of climate change, while negative feedback loops can help to stabilise the system or slow down warming. Understanding these loops is essential for developing effective strategies to mitigate climate change and manage resources sustainably.</p>

<p>An example of a positive feedback loop is the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, which is partly caused by rising temperatures due to increased use of fossil fuels and the release of carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>However, the melting of ice removes a white surface of ice which has a high albedo, which is the ability to reflect the sun's rays. Therefore, the darker seawater absorbs the sunlight and heats up. This causes warming and in turn causes more intense heatwaves. During these heatwaves, people tend to use more air conditioning, increasing energy demand—currently primarily powered by fossil fuels. This use and burning of fossil fuels releases more greenhouse gases, continuing and amplifying the cycle of climate change.</p>

<p>An example of a negative feedback loop is when an action reduces or balances a change and helps to slow the effects of climate change. For example, protecting or replanting trees—such as in agricultural areas—can help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which in turn can reduce the warming effect. Trees also interact with the water cycle by releasing moisture and forming clouds, which reflect sunlight and help cool the area.</p>

<p>In cooler, more stable conditions, crops grow better, which means farmers don’t need to clear new land for agriculture. Keeping those forests intact helps store even more carbon. These clouds will then travel and distribute water into other regions, supporting the water cycle and helping to protect both food security and the environment.</p>

<p>Climate change isn’t just an environmental issue—it’s a resource issue, a health issue, an economic issue.</p>

<p>The choices we make today shape the future for generations.</p>

<p>We’ve got the tools. We just need the will to use them.</p>

        <h3 id="Vid01a">The Tipping Points of Climate Change — and Where We Stand </h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Johan Rockström | TED</strong></p>
        <h4>Intro</h4> <p>We Earth system scientists and climate scientists are getting seriously nervous. The planet is changing faster than we have expected. We are, despite years of raising the alarm, now seeing that the planet is actually in a situation where we underestimated risks. Abrupt changes are occurring in a way that is way beyond the realistic expectations in science.</p>

<h4>Planetary Boundary Framework</h4> <p>Fifteen years back, I introduced the planetary boundary framework, the scientific framework with the nine Earth system processes that determines the stability, the resilience and the life support on planet Earth. Ten years back, the world signed the Paris Climate Agreement. Almost five years back, we entered the decisive decade where our choices will determine the future for all generations on planet Earth. Where are we on this journey, halfway into this decade? I will give you a scientific state of the planet report, the most objective assessment that science can give today. And it starts here.</p>

<p>We've reached 1.2 degree Celsius of global mean surface temperature rise, the warmest temperature on Earth over the past 100,000 years. We have just scratched on 1.5 degree Celsius as an annual mean in 2023. But what worries us most is this: we are starting to see an acceleration of warming over the past 50 years. 0.18 degrees Celsius per decade from 1970 to 2010. But then from 2014 onwards, it abruptly jumps up to 0.26 per decade. And if we follow this path, we will crash through two degrees Celsius within 20 years and hit three degrees Celsius by the year 2100, a disastrous outcome, caused by us humans.</p>

<p>But it's not only carbon dioxide. Any parameter that matters for human well-being and our economies look the same. Here you have it, linear change up until the 1950s, we go into the great acceleration. And this is what we're seeing across overconsumption of fresh water, the sixth mass extinction of species, over-putrefying our freshwater systems with nitrogen and phosphorus, all of it undermining the stability of the planet. As if this was not enough,</p>

<h4>Impacts across the economy</h4> <p>We are seeing that this is now causing impacts across the entire economy. We're seeing bigger and bigger invoices being sent by the Earth system onto societies across the entire world, in droughts, floods, heat waves, disease patterns, human-reinforced storms, scientifically attributed to human-caused climate change. Forty degrees Celsius of life-threatening heat across all continents, occurring in 2023. Fifty-two degrees Celsius hitting the over 1,000 who lost their lives at the Hajj pilgrimage in June in Mecca.</p>

<h4>Higher climate change risks</h4> <p>Three times higher climate change risks now attributed to our cause of climate change. 2023, up to 12,000 deaths, 200 billion US dollars of cost, just in the US, up to 100 billion US dollars. This is seriously causing economic costs. We have scientifically, in the past, shown that this could cost a few percent of global GDP of the climate impacts caused by us. I can tell you that the latest scientific assessment is what you see on the screen here. An 18-percent loss of GDP by 2050 if we now follow the current path. This is equivalent to 38 trillion US dollars of loss per year in 2050. It's starting to hurt. Both in human social costs and an economic cost.</p>
<p>And this is happening at 1.2 degrees Celsius of global mean surface temperature rise. And we're following a pathway that takes us to 2.7 degrees Celsius in only 70 years. And we've had a 10,000-year period where our civilizations have developed, where we've had an enormous privilege of a planet at 14 degrees Celsius, plus or minus 0.5 degrees Celsius. That's the Holocene since we left the last ice age. And if you look three million years back, we never exceeded two degrees Celsius. That's the warmest temperature on Earth during the entire Quaternary. The coldest point, minus five degrees Celsius, Ice Age. I call this the “corridor of life.”</p>

<h4>Buffering capacity</h4> <p>Is it surprising that we scientists are getting really, really nervous? But it's more. It's so much more than this. The first issue is buffering capacity. The second is the risk of crossing tipping points, and both are moving in the wrong direction. Buffering capacity is the Earth system's ability to dampen shocks and stress. Like, for example, soaking up greenhouse gases in intact nature on land and in the ocean. And so far, Mother Earth has been so forgiving. Here we have the evidence. What you see here is the hockey stick of fossil fuel burning in red and deforestation in yellow. Is it this tremendous climate forcing that has caused the 1.2-degree Celsius climate crisis so far? The answer is no. Fifty-three percent of the carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning and land system change has been soaked up by intact nature on land and in the ocean. It’s only the blue sliver you see here, which remains in the atmosphere, causing the climate crisis so far.</p>

<h4>Land</h4> <p>The problem is we have more and more scientific evidence of cracks in this system. Let's start on land. Land absorbs 31 percent of the carbon dioxide from our greenhouse gas emissions. We have more and more scientific evidence across so much research that the boreal forest in Canada, or the temperate mixed forest in Germany and Russia are starting to lose their carbon uptake capacity. Did you know that the latest science shows that the part of the Amazon rain forest, planet Earth's richest biome on terrestrial land, has already tipped over and is no longer a carbon sink? It is today a carbon source. It's no longer helping us.</p>

<p>But as if that was not enough, what really worries us today is the ocean.</p>

<h4>Ocean</h4> <p>The ocean absorbs 90 percent of the heat caused by human-induced climate change. This is well understood, but what really worries us is what you see here. This is the latest data on sea surface temperature across the ocean. What you see here is from 1980 until today, how gradually the ocean surface just gets warmer and warmer. It's actually warming all the way down to 2,000 meters depth. This is well understood in science. It's a deep concern. It's well represented in the climate models, we understand it. Then suddenly in 2023, something happens. Temperatures just go completely off the charts. 0.4 degrees Celsius outside of the warmest temperature in previous years. What's happening? We admittedly must be honest here, we do not know. El Niño is certainly partly to blame but cannot explain it all. 2024, it just continues. What is happening?</p>

<h4>Energy</h4> imbalance <p>We do not know. But the candidate number one is the energy imbalance caused by us humans. In one year alone, the heat equivalent to 300 times global electricity use is absorbed in the Earth's system. Is it what we see on the screen here, an ocean that is starting to lose resilience? An ocean that is at risk of releasing heat to the atmosphere and self-amplifying warming? We do not know. But one thing is for certain, the ocean is sounding the alarm.</p>

<p>Reasons for concern, yes. We are now at a point where we are forced to ask the following question: Are we at risk of pushing the planet out of the basin of attraction, the stability of the planet, where we’ve been since we left the last Ice Age, the extraordinarily stable Holocene state? And if we pushed ourselves outside, drifting away unstoppably towards a hothouse Earth where we get self-amplified warming and losing life support on Earth. What could take us there?</p>
<p>Well, we know it. It is if we cross tipping points, big systems like the Greenland ice sheet, the overturning of heat in the North Atlantic, the coral reef systems, the Amazon rainforest are tipping element systems. Push them too far, and they will flip over from a desired state that helps us to a state that will self-amplify in the wrong direction, going from cooling and dampening to self-amplifying and warming. A rainforest tips over to a Savannah state.</p>

<p>Now we have now mapped the 16 tipping element systems, which are now scientifically catalogued, that regulate the climate system. These 16, and you see the five in the ground zero on planet Earth, in the Arctic, are connected via cascades through the ocean, particularly via the AMOC, the Atlantic overturning of heat in the ocean, all the way down to Antarctica. These are big biophysical systems that we all depend on, global commons for the stability of the planet. The question is, at what temperatures are they at risk of tipping from helping us to becoming self-amplifying foes?</p>

<p>Well, for the first time, we have an attempt to answer that question.</p>

<h4>Risk of tipping</h4> <p>What you see here are the 16 tipping element systems on the y axis, and in red you see the uncertainty range, the best estimates in science, darker the red, the higher the risk of tipping, it's the temperature levels at which they're likely to cross the threshold. The average temperature at which they are likely to tip is the yellow circle lines you see here. What this tells us is the following. Five of these 16 are likely to cross the tipping points already at 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p>

<h4>Tipping points</h4> <p>The Greenland ice sheet, the West Antarctic ice sheet, abrupt thawing of permafrost, losing all tropical coral reef systems and collapse of the Barents Sea ice. And just the two ice sheets hold ten-meter sea level rise, which would be unstoppable on the long term. Now sure, there is scientific uncertainty here, as you see from these graphs, but there's one red thread in science for humanity in the scientific message. And it's this: the more we understand of the Earth's system, the higher is the risk.</p>

<p>And here is the proof.</p>

<h4>The proof</h4> <p>This is five IPCC assessments the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 30 years of scientific advancements. Here again you see risk assessment, darker the red, higher the likelihood of causing irreversible change in the climate system. Thirty years back, the risk was put at five degrees Celsius of tipping and coming down to current state of science, the risk is set at 1.5 to two degrees Celsius. We are in the midst of a danger zone today.</p>

<h4>The danger zone</h4> <p>But it can be even worse than that. Let's go to the Amazon basin, again, the richest terrestrial ecosystem on land, climate science estimates the risk of the Amazon rainforest tipping over irreversibly to a savanna at three to five degrees of global mean surface temperature rise. A really high temperature, unlikely even to be met over the next 70 years. But if we lose forest cover, the risk is that the system can tip already at 1.5 to two degrees Celsius if we lose more than 20 to 25 percent of forest cover. So that's a very dangerous combination.</p>

<p>Where are we today? We are at 1.2 degrees Celsius of global mean surface temperature rise and 17 percent of deforestation. We are very close to a tipping point in the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<h4>Avoiding tipping points</h4> <p>Very close. What shall we do to avoid these unmanageable outcomes? Well, the IPCC is clear on the pathway. To stay under 1.5 degrees Celsius, to avoid crossing tipping points, we need to operate, to navigate within the global carbon budget that gives us a chance of holding 1.5. What remains for us is only 200 billion tons of carbon dioxide that we can continue emitting to have a 50 percent chance of holding 1.5. We emit today 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year, giving us five years at current rates of emission before we've consumed the budget. We are seriously running out of time.</p>

<p>And the pathway for a safe landing is also well studied and understood. You have it here. Bend the curve of emissions immediately and follow a path where we reduce emissions by at least seven percent per year for a safe landing and a net zero world economy by 2050.</p>

<p>But it's more than that. We also know that even if we succeed with this, we have already loaded the atmosphere with so much greenhouse gases, with so much climate forcing, that we inevitably face a period of overshoot. We must now be prepared for a very likely breaching of the 1.5-degree-Celsius planetary boundary on climate somewhere between 2030 and 2035. In five to 10 years' time. And then have, at best, a 30-40 year period of overshoot before we can come back to 1.5 by the end of this century. We would exceed with 0.1 to 0.3 degrees Celsius the 1.5 limit, meaning up to 1.8 degrees Celsius.</p>

<h4>Message 1</h4> <p>Buckle up What does this tell us? Well, I can tell you there are two main messages. Message one: Buckle up. We know for certain, 100 percent certainty, that this means more droughts, more floods, more heat waves, more human-reinforced storms, more disease during one generation's time. 2023, the warmest year on record, will be looked back upon as a mild year.</p>

<h4>Message 2</h4> <p>Planetary Boundaries Why would the planet come back to 1.5 after overshoot? Well, the answer is very simple. The health of the planet must be kept intact. We must continue having a planet that can absorb 50 percent of the carbon dioxide. We must have a planet that crosses no tipping points. We must have a planet that remains healthy and keeping heat intact in the ocean. That is why we need planetary boundaries. The planetary boundary framework that defines the nine Earth system processes that regulates the stability and resilience of the entire planet: climate, biodiversity, nitrogen, phosphorus, land, fresh water, air pollutants and chemicals.</p>

<h4>The Challenge</h4> <p>That is the challenge. To summarize that, there is no 1.5 degrees Celsius delivery on the Paris Agreement by only phasing out fossil fuels. We also need to come back into the safe operating space of the nature-based biodiversity, all the planetary boundaries of nature. This means that science is clear. The window is rapidly closing, but there is still some light in the window. We actually have evidence that we've reached a pivotal point, not only in terms of risk, but also in terms of opportunity to transform the world towards a safe and just future for humanity.</p>

<h4>Linear Change</h4> <p>Linear change is no longer an option. The only option is exponential change. We know that the only currency that matters is speed and scale. We also need to become stewards of the entire planet. We need to now recognise, from local to global level, that we're all so intertwined that we must govern the entire planet. I know, that is very daunting, but what choice do we have when on the line is the future of our children on planet Earth?</p>
<h4>Solutions</h4> <p>And we have the solutions. We know that solving the planet crisis is not utopia. It's not fantasy. We have the solutions for a secure, stable future for humanity. What are those transformations? Well, we know them. It's a rapid transition away from fossil fuels. It is a transition towards circular business models. It is transitioning towards healthy diets from sustainable food systems. And it's not only halting loss of nature, it's also scaling the regeneration and restoration of marine systems, soils, forests and wetlands. We have solutions for all of these. Just take green energy, which today is cheaper than fossil fuel-based energy.</p>

<h4>Our Choice</h4> <p>It's our choice that we're facing today. Now I was nervous already in 2020 when we entered this decisive decade and had to cut global emissions by half by 2030. Halfway into this decade, the road is steeper than ever. It's steeper than ever. This is what really, really concerns us. That we have a situation where we now need to move so fast. And I've been standing on stages like this so many times, sharing the dire scientific diagnostic. But still, I just told you that I do conclude that there is still some window open. There is a light in the tunnel.</p>

<p>And you may ask, what is it that makes me able to continue to be a realistic optimist in this situation? The most dire situation, I must admit, in my whole professional life. Well, actually, I promise this is an honest statement. There are so many positive items as well. The most important one in my mind is that we have ample evidence that citizens across the world, a majority of them, care about nature and climate. They trust climate science, they're concerned about climate change, and they want solutions.</p>

<p>And the second key factor is that we have so much evidence today that the solutions are not only available, but if we implement them, we get a more healthy, stable, secure future with the jobs and the economies that can compete and provide livelihoods into the future. This means, dear friends, that solving the planetary crisis is not only necessary, it is possible, and we all win if we succeed.</p>

<p>Thank you very much. (Applause)</p>

        <h3 id="Vid02a">What is the tragedy of the commons? </h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Nicholas Amendolare | TED</strong></p>
       <p>Imagine as a thought experiment that you live in a small village and depend on the local fish pond for food. You share the pond with three other villagers. The pond starts off with a dozen fish, and the fish reproduce. For every two fish, there will be one baby added each night. So, in order to maximise your supply of food, how many fish should you catch each day? Take a moment to think about it. Assume baby fish grow to full size immediately and that the pond begins at full capacity, and ignore factors like the sex of the fish you catch.</p>

<p>The answer? One, and it's not just you. The best way to maximise every villager's food supply is for each fisherman to take just one fish each day. Here's how the math works: if each villager takes one fish, there will be eight fish left overnight. Each pair of fish produces one baby, and the next day, the pond will be fully restocked with twelve fish. If anyone takes more than one, the number of reproductive pairs drops, and the population won't be able to bounce back. Eventually, the fish in the lake will be gone, leaving all four villagers to starve.</p>

<p>This fish pond is just one example of a classic problem called the tragedy of the commons. The phenomenon was first described in a pamphlet by economist William Forster Lloyd in 1833 in a discussion of the overgrazing of cattle on village common areas. More than 100 years later, ecologist Garrett Hardin revived the concept to describe what happens when many individuals all share a limited resource—like grazing land, fishing areas, living space, even clean air. Hardin argued that these situations pit short-term self-interest against the common good, and they end badly for everyone, resulting in overgrazing, overfishing, overpopulation, pollution, and other social and environmental problems.</p>

<p>The key feature of a tragedy of the commons is that it provides an opportunity for an individual to benefit him or herself while spreading out any negative effects across the larger population. To see what that means, let's revisit our fish pond. Each individual fisherman is motivated to take as many fish as he can for himself. Meanwhile, any decline in fish reproduction is shared by the entire village. Anxious to avoid losing out to his neighbours, a fisherman will conclude that it's in his best interest to take an extra fish, or two, or three. Unfortunately, this is the same conclusion reached by the other fisherman—and that's the tragedy. Optimising for the self in the short term isn't optimal for anyone in the long term.</p>

<p>That's a simplified example, but the tragedy of the commons plays out in the more complex systems of real life, too. The overuse of antibiotics has led to short-term gains in livestock production and in treating common illnesses, but it's also resulted in the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which threaten the entire population. A coal-fired power plant produces cheap electricity for its customers and profits for its owners. These local benefits are helpful in the short term, but pollution from mining and burning coal is spread across the entire atmosphere and sticks around for thousands of years.</p>

<p>There are other examples, too: littering, water shortages, deforestation, traffic jams, even the purchase of bottled water. But human civilisation has proven it's capable of doing something remarkable. We form social contracts, we make communal agreements, we elect governments, and we pass laws. All this to save our collective selves from our own individual impulses. It isn't easy, and we certainly don't get it right nearly all of the time. But humans at our best have shown that we can solve these problems—and we can continue to do so if we remember Hardin's lesson: when the tragedy of the commons applies, what's good for all of us is good for each of us.</p>

        <h3 id="Vid02">Managing resources for a finite planet</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Dr Jingyi Li </strong></p>
        <p>I would like to invite you to think about climate change from a slightly different perspective, one that is often overlooked but absolutely fundamental. That is the way we manage resources.</p>

<p>Climate change is not only about rising emissions or warming temperatures. At its core, it is a challenge of how we use, distribute, and sustain the Earth’s limited supplies of energy, water, land, and raw materials.</p>

<p>If we are to tackle climate change effectively, we must rethink our relationship with these resources. How we extract them, how we allocate them, how we reuse and regenerate them — all of these decisions matter. Increasingly, they shape not only the future of the planet but also the fairness and resilience of our societies.</p>

<p>Let me begin by explaining why climate change and resource management are so deeply interconnected.</p>

<p>The resources we rely on, such as fossil fuels, forests, minerals, soils, and water, are central to the causes of climate change. When we burn coal or gas, we release carbon dioxide. When we cut down forests, we destroy natural systems that absorb carbon. And when we overuse soil or deplete groundwater, we damage ecosystems that help regulate climate stability.</p>

<p>But the relationship also goes the other way. Climate change is already disrupting the availability of these very same resources. Droughts, floods, and shifting rainfall patterns are making water supplies less predictable. Warmer temperatures are accelerating soil erosion and land degradation. Sea level rise is pushing saltwater into freshwater aquifers, making them unsuitable for farming or drinking. Even mining operations are being affected by extreme weather, which can halt production and disrupt supply chains.</p>

<p>This creates a feedback loop. Poor resource management drives climate change, and climate change makes sustainable resource management harder. To break this malicious cycle, we need to rethink the way we manage natural systems.</p>

<p>Let us start with one of the most prominent areas of change, which is energy.</p>

<p>When we talk about transitioning to renewable energy, we often focus on technologies and emissions. But it is also a shift in how we manage resources. Fossil fuels are extracted, burned, and used up. Renewables, in contrast, rely on flows of wind, sunlight, and water, which must be captured, stored, and distributed.</p>

<p>This transition also requires vast amounts of physical materials. Lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements are needed for batteries, electric vehicles, and wind turbines. These materials are not infinite. They must be mined, refined, and transported — often under difficult environmental and political conditions.</p>

<p>Managing this new resource base responsibly means understanding where these materials are located, how to extract them with minimal impact, and how to design systems that allow them to be recovered and reused after their first use. Otherwise, we risk simply replacing one form of extraction and dependency with another.</p>

<p>At the same time, we must ensure that the energy transition does not deepen existing inequalities. Many of the materials needed for clean energy are found in regions that have long been shaped by extractive industries, often in the Global South.</p>

<p>A just transition means putting people at the centre of the resource shift, ensuring that workers in fossil fuel industries are supported into new, decent jobs, that supply chains are transparent and fair, and that affected communities are included in decision-making. Clean energy must not come at the expense of human rights, local environments, or social cohesion. It is not only a technological transition, but a social one, and resource management has a critical role to play in making it fair.</p>

<p>Now let us consider land and water. These are essential for both climate stability and human survival.</p>

<p>Healthy ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and peatlands absorb carbon dioxide and store it over long periods. But these landscapes are under intense pressure. Agricultural expansion, urbanisation, and logging are leading to deforestation and soil degradation, turning natural carbon sinks into sources of emissions.</p>

<p>Peatlands are a striking example. Although they cover just a small portion of the Earth's surface, they hold more carbon than all the world’s forests combined. Yet when drained or extracted, they release large quantities of greenhouse gases. Restoring peatlands and protecting soils is one of the most cost-effective ways to mitigate climate change.</p>

<p>Water systems are also becoming more vulnerable. Climate change is disrupting rainfall patterns, increasing the severity of droughts and floods, and reducing the predictability of freshwater supplies. Agriculture, which uses around 70 percent of freshwater globally, is highly exposed to these changes.</p>

<p>In industrial sectors, the effects are just as serious. Many mining and manufacturing processes depend on water for cooling and cleaning. When water becomes scarce or unpredictable, entire operations can be shut down. Rising sea levels can also cause saltwater to enter groundwater stores, which undermines both drinking water security and irrigation.</p>

<p>These are not just environmental concerns. They affect the economy, food systems, public health, and even regional stability.</p>

<p>Next, let us consider how all of this comes together in our cities.</p>

<p>Urban areas are where many of the world's people live and where most energy, water, and material consumption occurs. Cities are hubs of resource demand. But they are also sites of innovation and opportunity.</p>

<p>The way we build and organise cities determines how efficiently we use resources. Transport systems, housing, food supply, and waste management all play a role. If cities invest in efficient public transport, local renewable energy, sustainable buildings, and circular waste systems, they can reduce their resource footprint and become more resilient to climate impacts.</p>

<p>Examples include district heating networks, rainwater harvesting, and smart grids that balance energy supply and demand in real time. But such systems require integrated planning, political will, and investment in long-term thinking.</p>

<p>This leads us to a practical question. How can we actually manage resources in a way that is sustainable, fair, and fit for the future?</p>

<p>One useful framework is to think in terms of life cycles. Every resource has a life — from discovery and extraction, through use and consumption, to recycle or disposal.</p>

<p>It begins with knowing what we have. Conducting audits helps us identify where resources are, what condition they are in, and how much is available. In the UK, the British Geological Survey maps out strategic minerals like lithium in places such as Cornwall. These assessments are essential for aligning industrial strategy with environmental limits.</p>

<p>Once we understand availability, we need to plan how resources are allocated. This involves identifying where demand is highest, where trade-offs exist, and how environmental impacts can be minimised. A strong example of this is the marine spatial planning led by the Crown Estate. It manages rights to the seabed around the UK, balancing offshore wind development, marine conservation, fishing, and shipping. Careful planning ensures these competing interests can coexist.</p>

<p>Monitoring and regulation follow. These processes help ensure that resource use remains within safe and just boundaries. Take the Energy Company Obligation scheme, which is regulated by Ofgem. This scheme requires energy companies to invest in home energy efficiency, especially in low-income areas. The result is lower energy use, reduced emissions, and improved social equity. It shows that good resource management is not only about conservation, but also about who benefits and who carries the cost.</p>

<p>Another essential part of sustainable resource management is thinking beyond extraction — towards restoration and repurposing.</p>

<p>Across the UK, old coal mines once associated with pollution and economic decline are being reused. In many places, polluted mine water is being treated using natural wetland systems. Some sites have been converted into public green spaces. Others are being used for mine water heating, a renewable source of energy that can warm homes in surrounding communities. This is a powerful example of how environmental damage can be reversed and turned into a public benefit.</p>

<p>Taken together, these examples show that sustainable resource management is not about doing less. It is about doing things differently. It is about recognising that we live on a finite planet, and that careful stewardship is essential for long-term well-being.</p>

<p>If resource management is about what we use, how we plan, and how we regulate access, then the circular economy is about how we keep those materials flowing within safe ecological limits.</p>

<p>The circular economy focuses on design. It asks us to design out waste, to create systems that enable repair and reuse, and to extend the life of products and materials. Instead of extracting, using, and discarding, the goal is to close the loop.</p>

<p>It is not simply about recycling. It is about rethinking entire systems so that we meet human needs while respecting planetary boundaries.</p>

<p>The circular economy is the focus of the next section. But for now, I hope it is clear that sustainable resource management is not a side issue.</p>
