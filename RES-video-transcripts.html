        <h3 id="Vid01">Introduction to climate change and resource sustainability </h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Dr Elisabeth Allen</strong></p>
        <p>Everything we use—our food, water, energy, and even our phones—comes from natural resources. But did you know that the way we use those resources is changing the world around us through climate change? And as the climate changes, it's also putting those same resources at risk. This short video will explain how resources such as food, fuel, and water, which are essential for life, are interlinked with climate change.</p>

<p>Think about your daily routine—turning on the lights, driving to work, eating a meal, or scrolling on your phone. Every one of those things depends on resources. Non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels, minerals, and metals take millions of years to form, whereas natural renewable resources such as sunlight, wind, and water will naturally replenish. However, the rate at which we use them can have adverse consequences.</p>

<p>Since the Industrial Revolution, we have been burning non-renewable fuel resources such as coal, oil, and gas to power our homes, cars, and factories. It’s the main way we produce energy around the world. But burning those fuels releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that traps heat in Earth’s atmosphere.</p>

<p>Food is another resource. Growing food uses land, water, and fertiliser. And raising livestock—especially cows—produces methane, a greenhouse gas that can have more adverse effects than carbon dioxide. Plus, forests are often cleared to make room for farms or pastures, which means fewer trees to absorb carbon from the air.</p>

<p>Water is another resource that is essential for all life on Earth. Whilst water is a renewable resource due to the Earth's water cycle, it is also a finite resource, meaning there's a limited amount of freshwater available for human use. Pumping, treating, and transporting water all use energy, and in many areas, overusing water can harm ecosystems or reduce natural carbon storage like wetlands.</p>

<p>So the way we use resources—energy, land, water, and raw materials—is deeply tied to climate change.</p>

<p>Let’s start with water. As temperatures rise, we’re seeing more droughts in some areas and heavier floods in others. Glaciers and snowpacks—nature’s water storage—are melting faster than ever, which puts millions at risk of losing their main source of freshwater. Rivers are shrinking, and underground water supplies are drying up in places where they’re needed most.</p>

<p>Next is food. Crops like wheat, rice, and corn don’t grow well in extreme heat or without steady rain. Unpredictable weather, longer dry seasons, and more intense storms are making it harder for farmers to grow enough food. That can drive up food prices and create shortages—especially in places already struggling.</p>

<p>Forests and ecosystems are also under stress. Wildfires, heatwaves, and pests that thrive in warmer climates are damaging large forest areas, which are crucial not just for wood and clean air, but also for storing carbon and regulating rainfall.</p>

<p>Even energy supplies are affected. Hydropower depends on steady water flow, and droughts reduce its capacity. Extreme weather can knock out power lines, damage infrastructure, and make energy less reliable—especially in places that depend on a single source.</p>

<p>So while climate change may seem like something abstract, it’s already reshaping the resources that keep our homes running, our bellies full, and our communities safe.</p>

<p>To add complexity to this all, the changes to resources and our climate can cause knock-on effects which in turn can create more changes and effects. These are called feedback loops.</p>

<p>Feedback loops, both positive and negative, play a crucial role in shaping climate change and influencing the availability of resources. Positive feedback loops amplify the effects of climate change, while negative feedback loops can help to stabilise the system or slow down warming. Understanding these loops is essential for developing effective strategies to mitigate climate change and manage resources sustainably.</p>

<p>An example of a positive feedback loop is the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, which is partly caused by rising temperatures due to increased use of fossil fuels and the release of carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>However, the melting of ice removes a white surface of ice which has a high albedo, which is the ability to reflect the sun's rays. Therefore, the darker seawater absorbs the sunlight and heats up. This causes warming and in turn causes more intense heatwaves. During these heatwaves, people tend to use more air conditioning, increasing energy demand—currently primarily powered by fossil fuels. This use and burning of fossil fuels releases more greenhouse gases, continuing and amplifying the cycle of climate change.</p>

<p>An example of a negative feedback loop is when an action reduces or balances a change and helps to slow the effects of climate change. For example, protecting or replanting trees—such as in agricultural areas—can help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which in turn can reduce the warming effect. Trees also interact with the water cycle by releasing moisture and forming clouds, which reflect sunlight and help cool the area.</p>

<p>In cooler, more stable conditions, crops grow better, which means farmers don’t need to clear new land for agriculture. Keeping those forests intact helps store even more carbon. These clouds will then travel and distribute water into other regions, supporting the water cycle and helping to protect both food security and the environment.</p>

<p>Climate change isn’t just an environmental issue—it’s a resource issue, a health issue, an economic issue.</p>

<p>The choices we make today shape the future for generations.</p>

<p>We’ve got the tools. We just need the will to use them.</p>
