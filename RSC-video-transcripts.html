        <p><strong>Speaker: Various</strong></p>
        <p>Climate resilience is a really difficult term.</p>

<p>It means different things to different people.</p>

<p>Some people would describe it as a very slippery term. It feels intuitive that you should know what it means, and it sounds positive. If you don't define it clearly, then it's very difficult to put into practice.</p>

<p>Personally, for me, climate resilience is all about ensuring our people and places are adapting and prepared for our changing climate.</p>

<p>It might be finding new ways of managing climate risk altogether.</p>

<p>It's really about how we cope with the challenges of climate change, how we exploit any benefits that come with climate change.</p>

<p>Climate resilience is the ability of systems, people, organisations, their ability to absorb shocks and recover from climate shocks and maintain particular functions that they might be doing.</p>

<p>A state of being that you get to when you've taken a whole range of adaptation actions and you can actually cope with and thrive, I suppose, under a different climate as well.</p>

<p>Climate resilience is about providing those stakeholders and individuals with information that they need to make informed decisions about the future.</p>

<p>I think what we all need to do is to use whatever skills we have to try to work with other people and pool our resources because that’s the only way we're going to get any traction on this.</p>

      <section class="accessibility">
        <h3 id="Vid01">Introduction to climate resilience</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Dr Lois Pennington</strong></p>
        <p>When we think about climate change, there is often a focus on mitigation, on cutting carbon emissions and net zero targets. But the impacts of climate change are already affecting communities around the world, and without interventions these impacts will worsen as we continue to emit greenhouse gases.</p>

<p>This challenge is all about climate resilience. That means our ability to cope with the changes that are already underway, and to prepare for what’s to come. We’ll explore how climate change is influencing extreme weather, who is most affected, and what it means to build resilience in a fair and inclusive way.</p>

<p>We’re going to focus on three key ideas. First, we’ll look at the link between climate change and extreme events, including how those events are changing over time and geography. Then we’ll explore the idea of adaptive capacity, in other words, who is able to respond and recover, and who isn’t. And finally, we’ll consider climate justice, the question of fairness in who is impacted, and how support is distributed.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the link between climate change and extreme events.</p>

<p>The world is getting warmer. Since pre-industrial times, global average temperatures have risen by around 1.2 degrees Celsius. But climate change doesn’t just mean things slowly heat up. It also means that weather is becoming more extreme, and more unpredictable.</p>

<p>Globally, the number of weather-related disasters has increased five-fold over the past 50 years, according to the World Meteorological Organisation. And those events are costing more, both in lives and in recovery efforts.</p>

<p>We’re seeing longer and more intense heatwaves, heavier rainfall leading to flash floods, and droughts that last for months or even years. Wildfires are becoming more frequent and more destructive. And storms are getting stronger, powered by warmer oceans.</p>

<p>Seasons are shifting. We’re seeing heatwaves in spring, floods in summer, and extreme weather patterns that don’t match historical expectations. And sometimes, multiple hazards happen close together, for example, a drought followed by a storm that causes landslides in dry, damaged soil. These overlapping events can be especially devastating.</p>

<p>This is part of what scientists call a shifting baseline. What was considered extreme 20 years ago may now be relatively normal. And that makes planning for infrastructure, for public health, for emergency services, much more complex.</p>

<p>While we can’t blame one specific storm or heatwave on climate change, we can say that climate change made that event more likely to happen, or more intense than it would have been otherwise.</p>

<p>So we know that extreme events are increasing, and that they’re changing. But their impact doesn’t just depend on the weather. It also depends on what’s already in place to respond to the event, and that brings us to our second key idea: adaptive capacity.</p>

<p>Adaptive capacity is the ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from climate-related hazards. It depends on a range of factors including how strong our infrastructure is, how well our emergency services can respond, whether people have access to healthcare, housing, information, and support. It’s not just about buildings and defences, it’s about people, systems, and the resources available to them.</p>

<p>Take a heatwave as an example. In a city with good infrastructure, green space, and accessible healthcare, people may find it easier to manage the risks. But in another city, or even a different part of the same city, where housing is overcrowded, ventilation is poor, and services are limited, a heatwave can be deadly. In addition, vulnerable groups, such as elderly or disabled people, are often at greater risk than healthy individuals, simply because they may have fewer ways to stay cool, stay mobile, or access support.</p>

<p>So the same hazard can cause very different outcomes, depending on who’s affected. And those differences are not random. They reflect deeper inequalities, in income, in planning, and in access to support.</p>

<p>This leads us to our third and final key idea: climate justice.</p>

<p>Climate justice recognises that while climate change affects everyone, it doesn’t affect everyone equally, and that inequality is often the result of systemic issues. The people and places most at risk are often the ones who have the fewest resources to cope, and furthermore, who contributed least to the problem.</p>

<p>Globally, this includes low-income countries that are already facing the brunt of climate impacts, despite having tiny historical emissions. It includes Indigenous communities who are fighting to protect land and ecosystems, while being left out of decision-making. It includes cities and regions where past investment has been limited, and where people are already dealing with poverty, poor health, or insecure housing.</p>

<p>But climate justice also matters within wealthier countries. In the UK, for example, marginalised communities may live in areas more exposed to flooding or air pollution. They may have fewer options for relocation, less access to support, and less influence over local planning decisions. So when we talk about building resilience, we can’t just talk about defences, walls, and warning systems. We have to talk about fairness, about who is protected, and who is left behind.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how these ideas play out in the real world.</p>

<p>In early 2025, wildfires in Los Angeles displaced thousands of people. The flames didn’t distinguish between rich and poor neighbourhoods, but the aftermath did. Wealthier residents were more likely to have insurance, access to temporary housing, and the means to rebuild. Others were left without support or permanent shelter.</p>

<p>In the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean, rising sea levels are already threatening entire communities. Some residents are making plans to relocate. These communities have contributed almost nothing to global greenhouse gas emissions, yet they are on the frontlines of the climate crisis, with limited capacity to limit impacts.</p>

<p>And in the UK, we’ve seen repeated flooding in areas around the country. Each year brings new images of submerged homes and emergency rescues. These events have highlighted how important local planning, infrastructure, and community support are in responding to climate impacts.</p>

<p>These stories are no longer unusual. They’re becoming part of everyday life, reminding us that resilience is not just about weather, but about systems, services, and fairness.</p>

<p>So, to summarise: climate change is already making extreme weather more common and more unpredictable. These events are changing in where they happen, when they happen, and how severe they are. The ability to cope with these events - adaptive capacity - varies hugely, depending on resources, services, and systems. And climate justice reminds us that how we implement resilience must be fair, not just effective.</p>

<p>As we plan for a warming world, we need to ask not only how we can reduce emissions, but also how we can protect people, and ensure that no one is left behind.</p>

        <h3 id="Vid02">Resilience over time</h3>
        <p><strong>Dr Chris Bowden</strong></p>
        <p>Climate resilience is about our ability to anticipate, prepare for, and respond to climate-related disruptions – from heatwaves to food shortages to extreme storms. But resilience doesn’t happen all at once or in the same way everywhere. It unfolds across different timescales – and these often reflect the spatial scale of action, from individual households to entire international communities.</p>

<p>In this video, we’ll explore how we build resilience across three key levels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The short-term, local scale – where individual choices matter.</li>
  <li>The short- to medium-term, regional scale – where collective action can reshape systems.</li>
  <li>The long-term, international scale – where cooperation and justice define our future.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s start by looking at the short-term resilience at the individual and local scale. Local actions are the front line of climate adaptation. The choices we make in our homes, neighbourhoods, and communities can have immediate effects – from reducing our exposure to climate risks, to strengthening local supply chains and social ties.</p>

<p>Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Choosing transport options that are less vulnerable to fuel shortages or flooding</li>
  <li>Adopting seasonal, local diets to reduce reliance on global supply chains</li>
  <li>Retrofitting homes to stay cool in heatwaves or retain heat in winter</li>
  <li>Supporting local environmental initiatives like urban greening</li>
</ul>

<p>These behavioural shifts may seem small, but they build momentum. Think of the UK's sharp rise in cycling infrastructure post-COVID – a response to public demand that’s now shaping urban policy and resilience planning.</p>

<p>For example, in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, the community-led initiative ‘Incredible Edible’ turned unused land into local food gardens. It increased food security, reduced reliance on imports, and fostered local engagement – a clear example of short-term, local resilience in action.</p>

<p>But while local action is essential, it’s only the first step. Without broader systems enabling and supporting these behaviours, progress can stall.</p>

<p>Next, let’s look at the short- to medium-term resilience at the regional and national level. When individuals act collectively – through councils, regional governments, or small-to-medium businesses – their ability to drive structural change increases substantially.</p>

<p>At this level, climate resilience is about adapting infrastructure and systems to withstand future conditions. Planning decisions about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Green spaces for urban cooling</li>
  <li>Flood-resilient infrastructure</li>
  <li>Accessible, climate-safe transport networks</li>
  <li>Building codes that consider future climate extremes</li>
</ul>

<p>…can either empower or constrain local action.</p>

<p>For example, in Greater Manchester, the ‘In Our Nature’ initiative uses urban green infrastructure to track and reduce carbon emissions, improve access to nature, and strengthen social cohesion. It’s a regional example of scaling up resilience through coordinated action.</p>

<p>Councils and businesses also shape the cultural narrative – what we normalise, invest in, and expect from daily life. Their decisions ripple across decades, especially when it comes to urban planning, land use, and community resilience strategies.</p>

<p>And finally, some aspects of climate resilience require global collaboration over the long term. We’ve already seen that coordinated international agreements can drive real and rapid change – as with the global phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) under the Montreal Protocol. This treaty helped reverse damage to the ozone layer – a rare success story in global environmental governance.</p>

<p>But it also exposed deep climate justice issues. While all countries complied, the cost of change was unevenly distributed. Wealthier nations had the means to transition quickly, while poorer nations faced steeper relative costs.</p>

<p>We face similar challenges today with climate adaptation. The nations that contribute least to climate change often face the most severe impacts. For instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rising cooling demands in tropical and subtropical regions</li>
  <li>Higher vulnerability to floods, droughts, and food insecurity</li>
  <li>Displacement due to sea level rise and extreme weather</li>
</ul>

<p>These realities require sustained funding, technology transfer, and international cooperation to support climate-resilient development around the world.</p>

<p>For example, the ‘Green Climate Fund’, established under the UNFCCC, is designed to help developing countries respond to climate change. It’s an evolving mechanism to address both long-term resilience and global climate equity – though challenges around financing and accountability remain.</p>

<p>Resilience is not a single decision, but a journey across time and scale.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the short term, individuals and communities are already taking meaningful action to adapt.</li>
  <li>In the medium term, councils and businesses can reshape systems to support that adaptation.</li>
  <li>In the long term, international cooperation must ensure both resources and justice are in place to protect the most vulnerable.</li>
</ul>

<p>To build a truly resilient future, we need all levels of society working together – each reinforcing the other. Only then can we ensure that climate resilience is not just possible, but fair and enduring.</p>

        <h3 id="Vid03">Adaptation and maladaptation</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Dr Ben Parkes</strong></p>
        <p>In the context of sustainability, adaptation means taking steps to reduce climate risks and vulnerability by adjusting existing systems. There are multiple types of adaptation and adaptations to each type of weather shock. In this video, we will focus on heatwaves as our weather shock, but the thought processes are equally valid for cold waves, extreme storms, or floods.</p>

<p>I don’t wish to get bogged down in formal definitions of groups, but instead provide some general types of adaptation to heat:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Infrastructural changes</strong> can include – air conditioning a building, building underground, adding shade to railway platforms.</li>
  <li><strong>Institutional changes</strong> can include – changing working hours, providing water to staff/customers.</li>
  <li><strong>Behavioural changes</strong> can include – turning on fans at home, keeping curtains closed in the hot part of the day, taking an extra shower, not doing high exertion exercise.</li>
  <li><strong>Nature-based adaptations</strong> can include – planting trees for shading, providing green space.</li>
</ul>

<p>In previous videos we’ve looked at the timescale of adaptation methods; now we’re going to spend some time on the physical scale too.</p>

<p>So, going back to my initial example of a heatwave, what sort of things can individuals do during the heatwave?</p>

<p>They can use a fan, or perhaps if they’re well off, turn on the air conditioning. They could change behaviour and take extra showers or head to a shopping mall and enjoy the air conditioning there.</p>

<p>At the local or regional scale during the heatwave, decision makers can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make public transport free to reduce the number of cars in cities (one engine instead of many).</li>
  <li>Distribute water to people and turn on municipal fountains.</li>
  <li>Increase provision of emergency services to account for the uptake in illnesses during heatwaves.</li>
  <li>Open up municipal buildings to allow people space to cool down.</li>
</ul>

<p>At national or international scales, the reactive decisions are similar to the regional ones:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bringing in water and emergency services.</li>
  <li>Ensuring local power stations have adequate fuel to power the increased energy demand for space cooling.</li>
</ul>

<p>As we covered earlier, as scale increases, so does the timespan ahead that you can plan. Individuals can only affect their own area; local councils can affect the region, and national governments interact with their international counterparts to form long-term plans.</p>

<p>With heatwaves in the future:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Individuals</strong> could invest in air conditioning or shades for their windows.</li>
  <li><strong>At regional level</strong>, a council can plant trees to increase shading or change the quality of steel in rails to prevent buckling for the local light rail system.</li>
  <li><strong>Nationally</strong>, a government can mandate maximum working temperatures or make agreements to purchase energy in the case of a future heatwave.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, adaptation is not always of benefit to people. This is known as <strong>maladaptation</strong> and occurs when the adaptive method is no longer beneficial to the user.</p>

<p>In the case of a heatwave, a fan is an adaptive measure when the air temperature is lower than the skin temperature of the individual – typically around 36°C. Once air temperatures exceed this, a fan will only blow warmer air onto the person and increase their heat loading.</p>

<p>Maladaptation can happen at wider scales too. Using schools or other publicly owned buildings as a refuge from the heat only works if the buildings stay cool. Should the power supply fail, then a gym or shopping mall turns from a cool refuge into a furnace of stressed people.</p>

        <h3 id="Vid04">One field, two uses: A win-win for food and energy?</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: AI</strong></p>
        <p>Welcome to a new deep dive. As solar panels become, well, a more common sight, you might have found yourself wondering what happens to the land underneath them.</p>

<p>It's a really critical question. Meeting global net-zero targets means we need vastly more solar power. The scale is just enormous.</p>

<p>How enormous are we talking?</p>

<p>Our source, a detailed road map from UK photovoltaics experts, talks about increasing global PV capacity by an order of magnitude by 2050. That's potentially going from under a terawatt in 2021 to somewhere between, say, 8.5 and maybe even 80 terawatts.</p>

<p>Wow. And the terawatt is a trillion watts.</p>

<p>A trillion watts. Exactly. So serious power levels.</p>

<p>That kind of scale must require significant land, right? Often creating competition, I imagine, particularly with agriculture.</p>

<p>Precisely, and that competition is really the core problem that this deep dive source explores. But it also points to a fascinating solution - agrivoltaics.</p>

<p>Agrivoltaics. OK, let's unpack this. Our mission today is to understand this land use problem. How agrivoltaics offers a solution, its sort of real world impact and crucially, how it builds resilience, especially as our environment shifts.</p>

<p>So, agrivoltaics is essentially well, co-locating PV panels and agriculture on the same piece of land.</p>

<p>Sharing the space.</p>

<p>Exactly. The source outlines several ways this looks in practice. It could be PVs integrated with traditional crops, maybe PVs with livestock grazing underneath, or even using the setup to support ecosystem services through careful vegetation management. Oh, and solar greenhouses are another type.</p>

<p>So it's not just one single approach, and how is this actually, you know built, do you need completely new panel technology?</p>

<p>Surprisingly, no, not necessarily. Most systems today actually use conventional crystalline silicon panels. The key difference is in the design. Things like greater spacing between the panel rows or raising the panels much higher off the ground so machinery or animals can fit underneath. Sometimes they're even set up vertically. The main goal is allowing enough light through for whatever is growing below, but the sources also mentioned some exciting emerging tech, things like semi transparent modules or flexible ones. Think organic PVs.</p>

<p>These could potentially go onto curved surfaces, or maybe even tune the light spectrum that reaches the plants.</p>

<p>Tune the spectrum. How does that work?</p>

<p>Well, plants only use specific colours, specific wavelengths of light for photosynthesis. So theoretically, you could let those wavelengths pass through and use the rest to generate electricity.</p>

<p>That sounds incredibly clever, and the potential benefits seem, well, pretty substantial.</p>

<p>Oh, they are compelling. The most obvious one is just alleviating that land constraint problem, right? Getting double duty from one plot.</p>

<p>Makes sense.</p>

<p>But it goes further. Agrivoltaics can actually improve agricultural yield. Particularly in hotter, drier climates, because the panels provide shade that reduces the temperature down at ground level and cuts down moisture loss from the soil.</p>

<p>Ah, like a kind of high-tech parasol for the crops. Precisely.</p>

<p>It can also mean local power for things like irrigation, especially in remote off-grid areas, plus protection from increasingly harsh weather, hail, maybe intense sun.</p>

<p>And I read it can even help the panels themselves.</p>

<p>Yes, that too. The vegetation underneath can have a cooling effect, which can actually make the solar panels slightly more efficient. And, crucially for farmers, there's that potential additional income stream from selling any surplus power generated.</p>

<p>It really does sound almost like a win-win, but what are the hurdles? It can't be entirely smooth sailing, surely.</p>

<p>No, it's definitely not. The source is clear about the challenges. For one, there's still a need for more specific research, best practices for different crops, different soil types, and various climates. Lots of variables.</p>

<p>Exactly. And costs can be higher both for installation and operation because the designs are often more complex, especially those raised systems.</p>

<p>And regulations.</p>

<p>That's another big one. Regulatory frameworks often haven't quite caught up. Things like zoning laws, planning permissions, and even subsidy rules for farmers might not properly account for this kind of dual land use yet.</p>

<p>OK. That makes sense.</p>

<p>And linking this back to the environmental side, what's particularly striking is how directly agrivoltaics ties into resilience. That shading effect we talked about. It isn't just about boosting crop yield day-to-day; it's a direct strategy against environmental stress. Think heat waves, drought, which well, we know are becoming more frequent and intense.</p>

<p>So that's where the resilience piece really clicks into place. The source stresses that future research absolutely must look at how agrivoltaics performs under, you know, future climate change scenarios and how these systems can be designed to be more inherently resilient to increased extreme weather, maybe even using them as a tool for climate adaptation planning itself.</p>

<p>Exactly right. Which raises the really important question. How do we best optimise the interaction between the energy generation and the agriculture?</p>

<p>What does that involve?</p>

<p>It means more research into specific crop suitability under panels, developing whole system models that look at both energy and agricultural outputs and really understanding the long-term ecological impacts. And that novel PV tech, the kind that might let us tune the light spectrum that could be a key part of the optimisation puzzle going forward.</p>

<p>This deep dive into agrivoltaics really shows how solar technology is evolving, doesn't it? Moving beyond just, you know, sticking panels in a field somewhere. Definitely. It's becoming about integrated systems that can potentially solve multiple urgent problems all at once. Agrivoltaics is such a prime example, taking a potential conflict - land for food versus land for energy - and trying to turn it into a synergistic relationship that actually enhances both.</p>

<p>A truly powerful idea, especially for navigating the challenges ahead. So here's something for you listening to consider. If we can successfully combine food and energy production on the same land, what other seemingly competing needs in our society could we potentially address with these kinds of innovative, integrated solutions? What possibilities stand out to you from this idea?</p>
