        <h3 id="Vid01">Introduction to environmental justice</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Dr Rose Pritchard</strong></p>
        <p>Environmental justice means that everyone – regardless of race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status – has the right to the same environmental protections and benefits.</p>

<p>All around the world, vulnerable communities are more likely to experience environmental threats than others, such as natural disasters and environmental degradation.</p>

<p>For example, let’s think about flooding in the UK. People from areas classed as deprived face more flood risk than those living in less deprived areas. Floods disproportionately affect underprivileged neighbourhoods for several reasons, such as a lack of investment in flood control infrastructure and limited support when a flood does occur. Low-income families are also less likely to have insurance or live in well-constructed homes that are resilient to extreme weather.</p>

<p>As another example, there is overlap between heat vulnerability and socially deprived neighbourhoods in the UK. Low-income neighbourhoods are more vulnerable to heatwaves due to a combination of factors, including poorer housing quality and limited access to cooling measures and green space. Groups more susceptible to heat-related illness, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions, are also more likely to live in low-income neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, socially deprived communities often face multiple environmental threats at once, and these threats are being further compounded by climate change. A low-income community that is already more vulnerable to natural disasters is also more likely to live in the vicinity of polluting facilities, like landfills, mines, chemical manufacturers or radioactive waste storage areas.</p>

<p>The environmental justice movement works to document, understand and address/push back against these injustices, calling for policy change to prevent environmental problems that disproportionately affect marginalised communities.</p>

<p>The story of how the Environmental Justice Movement emerged is often traced back to Warren County, North Carolina in the United States. In the late 1970s, North Carolina’s government was deliberating where it could store 6,000 truckloads of soil laced with toxic chemicals. They decided on Warren County, whose population was rural, poor, and largely Black.</p>

<p>Protesters organised to oppose the construction of a hazardous waste landfill in the city of Afton. They were specifically concerned about chemicals leaching into the drinking water. Residents and allies marched for six weeks, and multiple lawsuits were filed in response. Although none of the cases were ultimately successful, this story inspired the rise of the environmental justice movement.</p>

<p>Over the next decade, the environmental justice movement gained momentum across the United States. Many different groups advocated for governmental action to ensure that the hardships caused by environmental threats, pollution and environmental degradation would not be further imposed upon any community, especially those already facing discrimination. The movement also drove a new field of research that exposed how environmental threats are disproportionately located in historically marginalised communities.</p>

<p>The environmental justice movement was born in the United States but, over time, the movement has gained traction elsewhere. Today, environmental justice struggles are taking place all around the world.</p>

<p>There is also growing recognition that the movement needs to think globally, as the distribution of environmental benefits and burdens across the globe is inequitable.</p>

<p>Climate change illustrates this point.</p>

<p>Certain countries have caused far more emissions contributing to climate change than others. Historically, industry was concentrated in the UK, USA and Europe. By some estimates, these regions are responsible for 79% of climate changing emissions made between 1850 and 2011. This historical concentration of industry and emissions is what has allowed countries like the UK to become wealthy.</p>

<p>Conversely, low-income countries – who have generally contributed the least to climate breakdown – are now bearing the brunt of the impact, particularly because many of these countries are located closer to the Equator and coastal areas where climate change’s effects are more harshly felt. As low-income countries have less stable infrastructure and fewer resources, they are more vulnerable to natural disasters and less able to recover when disasters do hit. People already living in poverty find it harder to recover from things like failed harvests, food and water shortages and destroyed homes when disasters hit.</p>

<p>The global environmental justice movement is concerned with these types of inequitable outcomes for different people across different places.</p>

<p>Much like in the 1970s, people are once again taking part in protests for global climate justice. Since 2018, millions of young people have participated in mass protests against climate injustice through groups such as Fridays for Future. Broader global movements have emerged too, such as the Climate Justice Coalition. These groups are seeking to influence the world’s most powerful decision-makers and their response to global environmental injustices.</p>

<p>In response to these calls for change, policy change is slowly happening. The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report and the Paris Agreement both emphasise the importance of climate justice in global climate action. There is also growing discussion in international circles about compensation for the damage of colonialism and climate change – sometimes known as reparations – such as through the United Nations Loss and Damages Fund.</p>

<p>However, there remains a long way to go to ensure that environmental laws and policies protect everyone – regardless of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or where they are located in the world.</p>

        <h3 id="Vid02">Just transitions</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Professor Matthew Paterson</strong></p>
        <p>With the adverse impacts of climate change worsening each year, and the window for action rapidly closing, many countries around the world are attempting to stave off the climate emergency. This requires an unprecedented change in how we do things. </p>

<p>The current energy system is a major driver of climate change, accounting for around 75 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, transforming our current energy system is essential to mitigating the impacts of climate change.</p>

<p>The energy transition involves moving away from fossil fuel-based energy sources, - coal, oil, and natural gas - which currently supply about 80 percent of the world’s energy. The goal is to transition towards zero carbon sources of energy, such as wind power, solar power, hydropower and geothermal.</p>

<p>Alongside changing how energy is produced, the energy transition involves changing how energy is distributed and consumed. It involves not only adopting cleaner energy sources but also enhancing energy efficiency, improving energy storage and optimising energy use in key sectors, such as transportation and housing.</p>

<p>The just energy transition means moving to a more sustainable economy and society in a way that’s fair to everyone – including people working in polluting industries.</p>

<p>All around the world, there are groups of people whose livelihoods depend on polluting industries, either directly as workers or as part of the local communities that economically rely on these industries. The just energy transition seeks to ensure that no one is left behind or negatively affected by the energy transition, including workers, vulnerable communities, suppliers of goods and services, small business and consumers.</p>

<p>The idea that transitions away from existing industries must be ‘just’ first emerged out of the trade union movement in North America in the 1970s. Workers were being affected by increased regulations for polluting industries and a movement emerged to protect their rights and livelihoods.</p>

<p>The possibility of highly unjust transitions can be highlighted by how the UK has managed to eliminate coal from its electricity system. The start of this process of coal phase-out was the attacks on the miners’ trade union, with a key national strike during 1984-5. The coal industry in the United Kingdom was dismantled precisely in order to undermine the power of organised labour. Former coal workers were left unemployed and the communities which their work supported were destroyed. Many parts of the UK are still living with the consequences of this today and have not yet recovered.</p>

<p>These types of experiences have led to the rise to the idea that although a transition away from fossil fuel-based energy sources is necessary, this transition needs to be managed in a way that is fair for everyone, including workers, trade unions and communities dependent on fossil fuel industries.</p>

<p>Since the 2000s, the concept has become part of international climate debates, finding its way into the preamble of the Paris Agreement in 2015.</p>

<p>The 2015 Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty that provides a roadmap for global climate action, aiming to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius or less. The Paris Agreement calls the imperatives of a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work and quality jobs.</p>

<p>The impacts of the transition away from fossil fuels towards greener energy sources also have global impacts. In recent years, the concept of a just energy transition has gained traction at the global-scale, with the aim of ensuring communities, workers and social groups all around the world are brought along in the pivot to a net-zero future.</p>

<p>While just transitions need to compensate workers in industries that the transition eliminates, they also entail focusing on the new sorts of injustice that renewable energy industries can generate.</p>

<p>In particular, solar, wind, and electric batteries, entail the mining of a whole host of what get called ‘critical minerals’ – lithium, copper, cobalt, nickel, and the like. There is a rapid growth of mining in these sectors. But it is often being undertaken in conditions which are exploitative for workers, and highly damaging to local communities, for example by polluting water sources on which people depend for drinking and agriculture.</p>

<p>Addressing these questions, while not slowing down the pace of a global energy transition, is a critical issue for the pursuit of just transitions.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the energy transitions need to happen quickly to meet global climate goals. But it also needs to be just and equitable. A just transition must consider how all types of people will be impacted, including those that work in sectors we are transitioning away from. It must also address the risk of deepening global inequalities in energy access, as the transition to cleaner energy sources in some regions may have negative implications for others.</p>

        <h3 id="Vid03">The Sustainable Development Goals: What are they and what comes next?</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Dr Charis Enns</strong></p>
        <p>The Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, are set to expire in 2030 and it is now evident that the world is not on track to achieve sustainable development by 2030. In this video, we will discuss the world’s current sustainable development agenda and what might come next.</p>

<p>On 1 January 2016, world leaders adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at a historic United Nations summit. These 17 goals provide a roadmap for creating a more sustainable and just world for all by the year 2030. They include goals and targets for ending poverty and inequality, protecting the planet, and ensuring all people enjoy peace and prosperity.</p>

<p>The SDGs represent a major shift from earlier global development goals, known as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs, adopted in 2000, aimed to address a range of social and economic issues, such as poverty, hunger and gender inequality. However, they included little consideration for sustainability.</p>

<p>In contrast, the 17 SDGs centre sustainability, with goals and targets linked to the protection of nature, sustainable consumption, and climate action. They recognise that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.</p>

<p>Also, whereas the MDGs provided a set of development goals for developing countries, the SDGs apply to all countries. All 193 UN member states adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which means that every country that is a member of the United Nations has agreed to work towards achieving these goals. The SDGs are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the 17 SDGs are integrated: they recognise that action in one area or one part of the world will affect outcomes in others. They also recognise that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.</p>

<p>Although some progress has been made in areas like poverty reduction and child mortality, many SDGs are stalled or even regressing. We’re beyond the halfway mark to achieving the SDGs by 2030, and only 17% of them are on track. COVID-19, the cost of living, cuts to aid, conflict, the climate crisis – such as floods, heatwaves, wildfires – have set us back. </p>

<p>Climate change stands in the way of sustainable development. It exacerbates inequalities within and between countries, with poorer communities less able to adapt and recover from climate-related shocks. As extreme weather becomes more frequent and severe – think floods, droughts, and hurricanes – lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure are being destroyed, setting back education, health, food security, and economic stability. All this directly undermines our ability to meet the SDGs and is reversing decades of hard-won progress.</p>

<p>Other global trends have slowed down progress as well, such as declining political will and growing geopolitical tensions. This refers to tensions, rivalries, and wars between or within states, often rooted in competition over resources, territory, or power. While climate-related risks remain the biggest long-term threat to sustainable development, geopolitical tension and conflict create massive disruptions to sustainable development efforts too.</p>

<p>At the heart of sustainable development is the principle of multilateralism – countries working together through shared institutions. But the multilateral system is under growing strain. We’ve seen countries pulling out of key organisations and agreements, such as the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement and the World Health Organization. Without trust in these institutions and commitment to shared action, our ability to tackle issues that hinder sustainable development – like poverty and inequality, pandemics and climate change – becomes deeply compromised.</p>

<p>With the SDGs set to expire in 2030, and with significant progress still needed to achieve sustainable development, it is anticipated that the international community will soon begin laying the groundwork for what comes after the SDGs.</p>

<p>A new set of goals will likely be devised by global leaders to guide sustainable development. Although much remains to be determined, the next set of goals is expected to build on lessons learned from the MDGs and SDGs, while also considering the evolving needs of different countries and the world. This will take into account deepening global challenges such as climate change, geopolitical conflict, and declining interest in multilateralism.</p>

<p>Given the deepening environmental crises that pose an existential threat to future life on Earth, some have suggested that whatever comes next must place even greater emphasis on environmental sustainability. There is discussion about merging goals for sustainable development with the need for a just transition. This has led to the proposal for "sustainability transition goals" in the post-2030 era.</p>

<p>One key barrier to centring sustainability in our post-2030 goals is economic growth. Poverty eradication has also long been the most important priority for sustainable development, as demonstrated by both MDG 1 and SDG 1, which focus on poverty and inequality. And, economic growth has typically been seen as the foundation of any effort to reduce poverty and inequality.</p>

<p>Yet, there is growing agreement that economic growth is a major obstacle to real sustainable development. This is because the main strategies we use to drive economic growth tend to conflict with environmental sustainability. For example, many of the sectors that contribute to national wealth, such as oil and gas extraction, mineral development and industrial agriculture, contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>While the MDGs downplayed the importance of environmental sustainability and the SDGs attempted to balance social, economic and environmental development, the next set of global goals may need to go further considering the deepening climate crisis.</p>

<p>Yet, prioritising the environment over the economy seems somewhat unlikely especially given the current global trends, such as the cost-of-living crisis. Whether global development goals will attempt to reconcile economic and environmental development objectives or shift towards a more radical agenda that truly centres sustainability remains to be seen.</p>
