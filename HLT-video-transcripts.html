        <h3 id="Vid01">Understanding the deep connection between human and ecosystem health</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Dr Anna Gilchrist</strong></p>
        <p>When we hear the word ‘health’, we are usually inclined to think of it in the human context and often fail to consider how interconnected our own health is with the ecosystems we live in.</p>

<p>However, the health of the Earth as a planetary system is fundamental to human health. In 2009, Johan Rockström’s work on planetary boundaries identified nine essential systems that support life. As of 2023, six of these boundaries have been exceeded due to human activity. Among them, the biosphere—our planet’s system of all living organisms—has been the most seriously compromised.</p>

<p>Ecosystem health is often measured through biodiversity, typically defined as ‘species richness’. But more importantly, ecosystem health relies on genetic diversity - within and between species - to support evolutionary processes and resilience.</p>

<p>As a result, many scientists have declared an ecological emergency. Planet Earth has seen five mass extinctions across its 4.5-billion-year history. The current, sixth extinction is the first driven by a single species: us.</p>

<p>Of an estimated 8 million known plant, animal and fungi species, around 1 million are now threatened with extinction. Some models suggest over 10% of genetic diversity in plants and animals has been lost in just the last 150 years.</p>

<p>There is now an urgent imperative to restore nature.</p>

<p>Despite this, biodiversity loss is often framed as less urgent than other environmental issues such as climate change or plastic pollution. These are, of course, serious challenges, but they are deeply interconnected with the biodiversity crisis. It is critical that biodiversity receives the same level of attention and action – and that we tackle these issues holistically.</p>

<p>So why is biodiversity loss often overlooked?</p>

<p>There are many complex reasons —social, cultural, political— but one of the simplest is also the most powerful: we just aren’t fully aware of nature’s decline. American ecologist Edward Wilson described biophilia, our innate human connection to nature. Children, in particular, show this connection clearly. But in adulthood, especially in Western cultures, this connection fades.</p>

<p>Each new generation grows up experiencing a more degraded version of nature than the one before. This phenomenon is known as shifting baseline syndrome. It was first described by marine biologist Daniel Pauly, who observed that younger fishermen were satisfied with their catch, unaware of the dramatic decline in the size and number of fish caught decades earlier.</p>

<p>Shifting baseline syndrome is reinforced by reduced time spent in nature, and a lack of data or personal memory of past ecosystems. It becomes a vicious cycle: with each generation knowing less of what was, and therefore it becomes harder to grasp what’s been lost—or what needs to be restored.</p>

<p>This loss has a huge impact on human health.</p>

<p>Biodiversity loss doesn’t only affect non-human species — it has serious implications for human health too.</p>

<p>Healthy ecosystems influence our physical health but also have strong links to mental health and wellbeing. Studies show that time spent in nature is beneficial across all demographics—improving outcomes for conditions such as anxiety, depression, addiction, and autism.</p>

<p>Nature exposure also supports child development, including cognitive, emotional, and physical growth. For example, children diagnosed with ADHD have been shown to have better concentration and behaviour after time in green, natural play spaces compared with urban environments.</p>

<p>More biodiverse, wild spaces offer greater benefits than manicured parks or grey urban settings. Though various theories explain this — such as the idea that nature restores attention and reduces stress — the message is clear: healthy ecosystems support healthy minds.</p>

<p>These benefits have led to initiatives like green prescribing, where medical professionals refer patients to nature-based activities.</p>

<p>But we need more than treatment — we need to embed opportunities for nature-connectedness across society and ensure the nature people encounter is genuinely rich and wild.</p>

<p>So, what do we need to do?</p>

<p>We must act in two ways: first, by halting further declines in genetic diversity— not just by preventing extinctions, but by protecting population numbers. Second, we must restore what has already been lost. Restoring ecosystem processes and rewilding by ‘putting missing species back’ – where possible, are all essential responses.</p>

<p>Much of what we’ve explored so far might feel disheartening—but there is hope. Recovery is possible.</p>

<p>Globally, efforts are underway to respond. The 2022 Global Biodiversity Framework recognises that protecting what remains is not enough—we must also recover nature. Restoration of ecosystem function, rewilding, and species reintroductions are being adopted in more and more places. These efforts are about transforming both our ecosystems and our relationships with nature.</p>

<p>We also need new ways of relating to nature.</p>

<p>Western cultures, in particular, have become detached from nature. For many, the idea of living alongside wild, thriving ecosystems feels unfamiliar or even uncomfortable.</p>

<p>To help reframe our relationship with nature, the Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) proposed four “life frames”:</p>

<p><strong>Living from nature</strong> – recognising the material benefits we derive</p>
<p><strong>Living in nature</strong> – valuing the places and cultures shaped by nature</p>
<p><strong>Living with nature</strong> – appreciating the interconnectedness of all life</p>
<p><strong>Living as nature</strong> – seeing humans not as separate from nature, but as part of it</p>

<p>This last frame—living as nature—asks us to shift our worldview. It suggests that humans are not above or apart from ecosystems but deeply embedded within them. If adopted at scale, this perspective could guide not only personal values but also institutional and political decisions.</p>

<p>Our health as a species is inseparable from the health of the ecosystems we depend on. Living as nature doesn’t mean abandoning progress—it means recognising that no one species has a greater right to health and survival than any other.</p>

<p>In restoring ecosystems and reimagining our role within them, we can create a healthier future—not just for humanity, but for all life on Earth.</p>

        <h3 id="Vid02">Sustainable environments and health: A global outlook</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Dr Catherine Walton</strong></p>
        <p>Human, animal and ecosystem health are inseparable. Life on land depends on clean air, water, and access to nutritious food. But these shared resources are under threat.</p>

<p>Human activity—such as uncontrolled urbanisation, habitat destruction, industrialisation, and unsustainable consumption—has accelerated environmental degradation to unprecedented levels.</p>

<p>These human activities also drive both non-communicable and communicable diseases.</p>

<p>With these challenges so closely connected, our solutions must be too. That’s where the EcoHealth approach comes in.</p>

<p>EcoHealth is an interdisciplinary framework that brings together diverse expertise, including public health, ecology, conservation, and social science to study the interdependence between human, wildlife and ecosystem health, and translate this understanding into sustainable and socially-just solutions.</p>

<p>EcoHealth recognises that we need to think in term of systems—not silos—and that addressing root causes of poor health means protecting the ecosystems we depend on.</p>

<p>The planetary boundary that has been exceeded the most is biodiversity.</p>

<p>Biodiversity loss includes not only species, but numbers of individuals within species. This reduces human health through the loss and depletion of key ecosystem services such as clean air, clean water and less fertile soil to grow nutritious food.</p>

<p>In addition, biodiversity loss, combined with habitat loss and growing human populations, results in changing interactions between people, wildlife and livestock that can drive the emergence and spread of infectious disease. It is not surprising then that we are increasingly seeing the emergence, re-emergence and spread of zoonotic disease. Zoonotic diseases are those caused by viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi that spread between animals and people. Scientists estimate that 3 out of every 4 new or emerging infectious diseases originated in animals (8).</p>

<p>For instance, COVID-19 is thought out to have originated in bats. COVID-19 is only one of a larger number of known coronaviruses that occur in a wide range of domestic and wild animals. COVID-19 was not the first zoonotic coronavirus to emerge into humans. Nor is it likely to be the last.</p>

<p>Another very important cause of zoonotic disease is mosquito-borne viruses.</p>

<p>The pandemic of Zika in 2015-2016 had devastating effects mainly due to microcephaly in infants and neurological disorders. Zika virus was originally transmitted by mosquitoes to monkeys in African forests, but was able to spread worldwide due to the global expansion of mosquitoes that have evolved to live in human-modified environments and to feed on humans.</p>

<p>Another mosquito-borne virus originally of zoonotic origin is dengue which is now endemic in the tropics and subtropics due to uncontrolled urbanisation.</p>

<p>A major but often underappreciated burden of zoonotic disease is pathogens transmitted by ticks which feed on wildlife, domestic animals and humans. In the UK there has been a dramatic increase in Lyme disease which can have serious long-term consequences if not treated in time. The increase in Lyme disease is due to increased numbers of deer together with changes in land use and climate.</p>

<p>If we increasingly invade and alter natural habitats it is almost certain that novel zoonotic diseases will emerge in the future.</p>

<p>EcoHealth supports sustainable, collaborative strategies that promote both human wellbeing and environmental resilience. The University of Manchester, for instance, aims to be a global leader in EcoHealth by integrating its world-leading research in human and ecosystem health with sustainability expertise.</p>

<p>Let’s explore what this looks like in practice.</p>

<p>In Africa we are working with local researchers on several EcoHealth projects. This includes studying the role of mosquito evolution and environmental change in the recent increase of the mosquito-borne viral disease, chikungunya. This research brings together expertise in evolution, ecology, geography, health, mathematics and social science from research institutes in Kenya and Malawi as well as the University of Manchester.</p>

<p>Another EcoHealth project in Kenya and Tanzania is the Shared Landscapes project. Pastoralist communities in the drier parts of these countries rely on livestock, particularly cows, as their main source of food. These drier landscapes still have large amounts of wildlife such as zebra, buffalo and antelope and are therefore shared by wildlife, humans and their livestock.</p>

<p>The Shared Landscapes project is studying how sharing of the landscape and the limited available water by humans, wildlife and livestock, influences the transmission of water-borne pathogens such as cryptosporidium and giardia. The understanding gained in both of these projects will ultimately translate into interventions to prevent or reduce disease transmission and conserve biodiversity.</p>

<p>EcoHealth isn’t just about restoring nature—it’s about recognising that nature is a form of public health infrastructure – it provides the essential facilities, systems, and services needed to maintain and improve public health and well-being.</p>

<p>According to the 2024 Living Planet Report, the hidden costs of environmental damage and poor health from the global food system alone total around $10–15 trillion annually, or about 12% of global GDP (9). In the long term we can save money and improve health outcomes if we invest now in Nature-based solutions that harness the power of nature to address societal challenges around health and the environment.</p>

<p>Nature-based solutions—such as regenerative farming, conservation, reforestation, and sustainable city design—could not only reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by up to 19%, but be vital to improving biodiversity and health.</p>

<p>But to make this happen, we need a major shift in how we value health, environment, and progress.</p>

<p>To create real change, we must move away from measuring success by economic growth alone. The Living Planet Report calls for a transition to a well-being economy—one that prioritises health, equity, and sustainability.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<p><strong>Changing consumption patterns:</strong> especially in high-income nations, where overconsumption is a key driver of environmental harm</p>
<p><strong>Transforming the food system:</strong> shifting to nature-positive farming, reducing waste, and encouraging more sustainable diets</p>
<p><strong>Rethinking energy:</strong> ensuring that renewable energy projects protect biodiversity</p>

<p>An example of this in action is the University of Manchester’s partnership with Enviromena, a UK clean energy company. Their solar farm in Essex not only provides clean electricity but also enhances local biodiversity through hedgerow planting and habitat restoration (10).</p>

<p>These kinds of projects demonstrate what’s possible when we align climate, nature, and health goals in one vision.</p>

<p>EcoHealth also emphasises inclusion. Solutions must be co-created with communities and guided by local and Indigenous knowledge. People must be part of the process—not just passive recipients (11).</p>

<p>In today’s world, the health of people and the health of the planet are deeply connected. Addressing one without the other is no longer possible. The EcoHealth approach offers a way forward—an integrated response to the climate, biodiversity, and health crises that shape our global outlook.</p>

<p>By reconnecting with nature, restoring ecosystems, and rethinking how we live, we not only protect the environment—we also improve mental and physical wellbeing, reduce inequality, and build a more just and sustainable future for everyone.</p>

        <h3 id="Vid03">Restoring landscapes, rebuilding wellbeing: The Carbon Landscape project</h3>
        <p><strong>Speaker: Dr Joanne Tippett</strong></p>
        <p>If we imagine the 4.55-billion-year-old story of the Earth as happening over one calendar year, it took until December for the build-up of natural capital to turn our planet from a barren rocky environment with no breathable atmosphere, to one covered with life. The whole of human civilisation, a 12-thousand-year-old story from the development of agriculture to the scientific revolution, happened in the last one and a half minutes to midnight on the last day of the year. The Industrial Revolution started two seconds to midnight, heralding an unprecedented increase in productivity, innovation, and environmental devastation.</p>

<p>Shifting our focus from the global to the local brings the issues we’ve been exploring closer to home. The places where we live — our towns, cities, and surrounding landscapes — are shaped by human choices over time, and they continue to shape our health and wellbeing in return. Local environments offer real opportunities for change. When communities come together to restore damaged landscapes, create green spaces, and care for shared places, the benefits ripple outward — for nature, for climate, and for people. These actions remind us that change doesn’t only happen through policy or technology — it also happens through relationships, shared knowledge, and a sense of belonging to place.</p>

<p>After all, one of our greatest untapped resources is human creativity. To tackle both the environmental challenges we face and growing anxiety about our future, there is a pressing need to find new ways to bring people together to develop positive alternatives and actions. This is especially true when considering how we transform our landscapes to promote nature recovery and climate action.</p>

<p>We need to unlock human potential and create human-centred solutions. Engaging with local people and the range of stakeholders involved in local landscapes means we can learn about what is special about these places and build our knowledge about them as a foundation for positive change.</p>

<p>Engagement is essential for a range of initiatives including nature conservation, ecological restoration, rewilding, urban greening, community gardening, sustainable forestry and agriculture. Meaningful engagement promotes collaboration, partnership working and co-design: it is ultimately about how people can work to create places where nature and people can thrive. The power of engagement lies in its ability to foster more inclusive decision-making, building skills, knowledge and trust whilst also improving environmental outcomes. It offers a path to delivering multiple, integrated benefits for people, nature and the climate.</p>

<p>The health of the planet is intricately tied with our health, and how we go about making changes in the landscape can also have profound implications for human wellbeing. Enhancing democratic participation in the design and delivery of landscape change fosters a sense of belonging and connection.</p>

<p>How we frame our thinking about the future matters. If we start from a perspective of hope, and a vision that a sustainable future is possible, we are more likely to inspire people to take part and take action. Humans are change makers, we can be protagonists in shifting our systems towards a sustainable future, as well as beneficiaries of the changes in our neighbourhoods and landscapes, as we bring nature back in to play a vital role.</p>

<p>The Carbon Landscape is an example of how engaging people in landscape recovery has made a difference. This was a flagship programme of the Great Manchester Wetlands Partnership, a £3.2 million National Lottery funded project to restore the landscape between Manchester and Liverpool. This is the landscape that fuelled the Industrial Revolution. It was left scarred by mining and mine closures that left a legacy of destroyed landscapes and unemployment.</p>

<p>The Carbon Landscape project included engaging with thousands of local stakeholders, community members, and school children and young people. It led to the restoration of key habitats including peat bogs across the landscape – vital for both carbon storage and adapting to climate change.</p>

<p>A key element of the engagement in the Carbon Landscape was setting our discussions in the context of a big picture of sustainability, The RoundView. This has emerged from 25 years of research and co-production at The University of Manchester to create a holistic way of thinking about our future. This acts as a navigational tool, that helps us understand how the earth works as a system, the three root causes of all environmental problems and their positive opposites. With this understanding, we can stop causing environmental problems in the first place and instead create a story of hope.</p>

<p>Taking this broader view encourages people to see their landscape within a global story of sustainability, from the formation of the Earth to the rapid changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution. In the engagement in the Carbon Landscape, taking this approach helped people to think bigger, beyond their patch, about how their activities can contribute to broader sustainability aims, such as climate change mitigation as well as nature recovery.</p>

<p>The level and scale of engagement with the community and local partners contributed to the declaration of two new National Nature Reserves, including the first post-industrial, urban National Nature Reserve in the former coalfields of Wigan and Leigh.</p>

<p>As the health of the landscape has improved, there have been major human health benefits, from increased opportunities for walking, cycling and play in nature, and from broader environmental benefits such as improved air quality and reduced flood and heat risks. As well as enhancing physical health, such landscape restoration projects have huge benefits for mental wellbeing, from enhanced access and connection to nature, the social connections from engagement, as well as building skills and confidence that has led to employment for many of the volunteers. Participants reported feeling a personal investment in the transformation of their local landscape, part of a larger picture of hope and change towards a regenerative future.</p>

<p>We are now working with the UK National Commission for UNESCO, to scale up this learning worldwide, working with more landscape partnerships, schools and libraries.</p>

<p>Thinking in terms of systems, we can see clear parallels between the health of the planet and health of the humans who live in its landscapes, breathe its air, eat the food it produces and drink its water. As greenhouse gasses rise and tree cover is lost, we suffer more from heat stress and extremes of weather, pesticides and microplastics are found in our blood and bodies.</p>

<p>Luckily we can now see a big picture of an alternative, designing human systems so that we live off solar income instead of fossil fuels, we keep synthetic substances, such as plastics, constantly cycling in the technical loop, and crucial for our wellbeing as well as our health, we promote wide-scale restoration of nature, and bring nature right onto our doorsteps in our towns and cities. We have the knowledge, tools and innovations we need to effect this transformation, and working together to imagine how this can look in our businesses, schools, neighbourhoods and landscapes can build social connections, as well as heal our connection to nature.</p>
